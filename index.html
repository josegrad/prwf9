The garden houses over 500 species of succulents and cacti from all over the globe and is divided according to region. Visitors can take a quick trip around the world through the world of cacti!
The garden was built between 1881 and 1883 for Leland and Jane Stanford on a site next to their proposed home. The neat, manicured style was considered old-fashioned in comparison to the more moden wild, naturalistic garden approach gaining popularity in the 1880s.

The garden fell into shambles after WWII and it wasn't restored until the late 1990s.
When the garden debuted, it was a favored place for students to take dates, evidenced by the lyrics to an old Stanford song: "Down by the cactus so silent and still/ the Junior has come to the question at last/ And love him? The maiden has promised she will." There is no evidence that the suggestive shapes of many of the cacti had anything to do with it.

The plaques are exquisitely executed with ornate typeface and Royal Doulton china designed by leading tile designer William De Morgan. They are a pleasure to behold in this small green space in such a built up area, even before you begin to unravel the story behind them.

Some examples of the plaques: 
'Soloman Galaman Aged 11, Died saving his little brother from being run over in Commerical Street in Sept 1901' 
'Alice Ayres, Daughter of a bricklayer's labourer, who by intrepid conduct saved 3 children from a burning house...at the cost of her own young life, April 1885'

      	<div class="entry_summary">Peter Mitterhofer Typewriter MuseumTypewriter museum housing more than 1,500 machines preserves the history of the grandfather of computers.Open since 1998, this purpose-built museum in Italy’s Bolzano region holds over 1,500 typewriter models in its permanent collection. The museum was built in honour of Peter Mitterhofer, one of the machine’s many accredited inventors, with the help of typewriter collector Kurt Ryba’s donation “for all times and as an inalienable cultural heritage.”
Spanning 4 floors, the museum displays its most polished examples as part of a vast chronology of key-punching and space bar slapping, complete with theatrical re-stagings for those unable to imagine how things were typed before repetitive strain injury was conceived.
 A brief history of the world told through one appliance, highlights include the Malling Hansen, the famous ‘writing ball’ device that looks as if it were developed by Enlightenment physicians, and the world famous German Enigma encryption machines, the deciphering of which were, for some, instrumental in the Allied war effort. Occasional tables are set for viewers to have a go themselves, and punch a few lines into their tickets to take home as a memento. 
Mitterhofer was, as might be expected, an eccentric character, who “often argued with priests and policemen”. The first objects that he constructed range from a washing machine, a guitar, an instrument called the Hölzerne Glachter, which produces a laughing sound, to more mundane loudspeakers and picture frames. His first typewriter, produced in 1864 was deemed by Mitterhofer to be a ‘failure’, though in fact, of all the early machines, the shape and key format of his prototype most closely resembles the mass-produced models that prevailed. 
A show of interest to the museum’s staff could lead to a visit to the basement or “special showroom”, clad with wall-to-wall shelves that are stacked with the machines that the museum couldn’t quite squeeze in to its displays. Not for the faint-wristed, this archive contains all of the models that evade the typewriter canons: from black glossy proto-surrealist elegance to bright Disney playthings, along with all of the bakelite and melamine - Casio Elite, Smith Corona Deluxe, the IBM Selectric, and many, many more - that took their glimpses in the limelight inbetween.Read more about Peter Mitterhofer Typewriter Museum on Atlas Obscura...Category: Unique Collections, Instruments of Science, Electrical Oddities, Amazing AutomataLocation: Parcines, ItalyEdited by: trowel, Rachel</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Ni'ihau IncidentA Japanese pilot crash lands on Ni'ihau after Pearl Harbor attack and terrorizes locals for a week When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7th, 1941, the island of Ni'ihau was inhabited by a mere 136 souls, most of which were native Hawaiians. Out of those who weren't, three happened to be of Japanese descent, two of which were born on Ni'ihau. Because of the island's small size and significant isolation, the Imperial Japanese Navy mistakenly characterized the area as uninhabited, and designated it as a place to crash land and/or rendezvous with a rescue sub after the onslaught.
Airman First Class Shigenori Nishikaichi's plane was damaged after taking part in the second wave of the attack, and as he had been instructed, crash landed on the deserted Ni'ihau. Much to his surprise he was approached by a Ni'ihau resident who had been standing 19 ft. away, and who while unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor, knew enough about current events to relieve Nishikaichi of his weapon and his papers.
Unable to communicate with the pilot and confused about his presence, the Japanese-speaking residents were summoned. Yoshio Harada, who was Japanese but Hawaiian born, was brought in along with his wife Irene to find out why the pilot was there. After a terse conversation in which Nishikaichi informed the two of the Pearl Harbor attack, Harada chose to keep the info to himself, and asked if the pilot could be relocated to his house until someone from the main island came to fetch him.
The absence of electricity and telephones on the island delayed news of the fate of Pearl Harbor, but a radio transmission alerted the people of Ni'ihau to the gravity of the  presence of their prisoner eventually, and Nishikaichi knew that his lax security among these gentle and welcoming people would soon come to an end. Employing the help of the Haradas as well as the only other Japanese citizen on the island, Ishimatsu Shintani, he overpowered the guards, retrieved his weapon, and took a 16 year-old girl as a hostage.
For the next several days, Nishikaichi and his converts terrorized the island in a mission to retrieve the pilot's papers, which Hawila Kaleohano, the man who had originally confiscated them, stubbornly refused to surrender. Women and children ran for caves and distant beaches as the men played an armed version of cat and mouse, Kaleohano hiding the papers with a relative and then setting out to get help as Nishikaichi frantically torched his plane and tore the island inside-out looking for his vital papers.
Finally, on December 13th, 6 days after the madness had begun, it abruptly ended. Harada and Nishikaichi, desperate to find the papers, took Ben Kanahele and his wife hostage and ordered them to find Kaleohano. Aware that Kaleohano had left the island, Ben Kanahele played along. Noticing the exhaustion of his captors, he watched and waited for the perfect opportunity to pounce. At the earliest distraction, Kanahele and his wife Ella sprung into action, and despite getting shot three times, he managed to overpower Nishikaichi long enough for Ella to smash his head in with a rock. Harada, upon realizing his new leader was dead and his treason would be exposed, Harada turned his shotgun on himself as Kanahele finished off the enemy pilot by slitting his throat.
 The privately-owned island of Ni'ihau is still fairly isolated to this day, open primarily to residents, their invited guests, and military personnel, giving it the nickname “The Forbidden Isle”. Since 1987, it has allowed limited tourism and supervised excursions on it's shores. The remains of Nishikaichi's Zero can be viewed on permanent display at the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor.Read more about Ni'ihau Incident on Atlas Obscura...Category: Anomalous Islands, Crime and PunishmentLocation: Hawaii, USEdited by: Rachel</div>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visiting one of the oldest living organisms in the world is actually quite easy.  Thought to be the eighth oldest tree in the world, the Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) affectionately known as the “Senator,” stands in a small park located in Longwood, FL. 
Its estimated age of 3,500 years makes it only slightly younger than the carefully guarded Great Basin Bristlecone Pine of California known as Methuselah. To get a good sense of how old this tree really is, one must keep in mind the “Senator” was alive not only during the time of Jesus, but for 1500 years before that when the Greeks destroyed Troy, the Olmecs were powerful in Mexico, Solomon succeeded King David, and Stonehenge was being constructed. Unlike the secret location of the ancient pine, this cypress is very accessible to the public.
The “Senator” is the largest tree east of the Mississippi and currently stands at 118 feet tall with a circumference of 35 feet.  A hurricane in 1925 damaged the top of the tree, shortening it from its original height of 165 feet.he tremendous size of the tree made it useful to both Indians and early settlers as a marker when traveling through the area.  Tourists have frequented the area to view the tree since the 1800’s and the land on which it resides was donated to Seminole County by the late Senator M.O. Overstreet to ensure the preservation of the tree.  It was in memory of Senator Overstreet that the cypress received its present name.  Following the donation in 1927, a ceremony hosted by President Calvin Coolidge, officially opened the property to the public in 1929.
Surrounded today by the Spring Hammock Preserve, the “Senator” shares space with a companion tree known as “Lady Liberty.” This companion Bald Cypress is a comparatively youthful 2,000 years old and stands 89 feet in height with a circumference of 32 feet.Read more about The Senator, Bald Cypress on Atlas Obscura...Category: Horticultural MarvelsLocation: Edited by: ronin, Dylan, Gumbotronic, Rachel</div>

Many have speculated that there is no way the tree could have "picked up" the bicycle if it had been left leaning against it  on the ground, as trees do not, by nature, grow up from the trunk, but from the top. The less cynical have pointed out that since the bike seems to be from the 1910s, the tree could have easily been a sapling, and a forked branch may have been weaved between parts of the bike and lifted it up over the decades.

Every day for a year, the golden Akita, dubbed Hachikō, would accompany his owner to Shibuya Station, and every day he would be waiting for the professor to return for the walk home.
One sad day, the train came, but Professor Ueno didn't appear. Hachikō returned the next day, and the next, but there was no way to tell the poor dog what had become of his master. The Professor had died of a stroke and would never step off of the train to greet him again.
For nine years, Hachikō waited for the train every day, only to leave alone. Commuters and station employees would feed him treats and keep him company, and an old student of the professor retraced the dog's genealogy, declaring Hachikō as one of only 30 purebred Akitas remaining. He became quite the celebrity over the years, inspiring books, films, art and poetry, and was present at the unveiling of his own bronze statue, a version of which still remains at Shibuya Station as a popular meeting spot.
When Hachikō died of a combination of cancer and worms in the streets of Shibuya in 1935, his remains were stuffed and mounted, and can now be visited at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno, Tokyo.Read more about Hachikō on Atlas Obscura...Category: Fascinating Fauna, Hunting and Taxidermy, Strange StatuesLocation: Tokyo, JapanEdited by: Rachel</div>

Behind the nondescript wall, a guard tower looms, and below it, a grim gate. This gate marks the entrance to Seodaemun Prison, a relic from a forgotten era in Korea's past seeped in subjugation and humiliation.  
Seodaemun Prison was opened in 1908 by occupying Japanese forces in an attempt to impose order on the newly acquired territory. Prior, the country had a virtually non-existent penal system, and the introduction of Seodaemun Prison was a precursor to full out occupation.  
Seodaemun became a bastion for the Korean independence movement from its opening in 1908 until the liberation of the country in 1945. As the Japanese arrested more patriots, the prison's notoriety increased and it eventually became a symbol of perseverance. Many patriots died in custody, were tortured to death, or were executed within the prison's walls. The macabre execution hall still stands, housing the prison's gallows (with a tunnel nearby to dispose of corpses).
Throughout the preserved prison-turned-museum, you can see chillingly recreated torture chambers, jail cells, isolation cells, and more. The women's section has been preserved, basement cells in which no privacy was afforded.  Some of the torture chambers have frighteningly realistic mannequins and effigies to famous Korean patriots who died within the prison.
Designated as a historic site in 1988 and renovated in 1995, Seodaemun is an interesting place to visit for those who want a tactile experience of the Japanese occupation and the horrors entailed. It stands out amongst Seoul's other historic sites as a monument to those who helped shape the modern Korean nation.Read more about Seodaemun Prison on Atlas Obscura...Category: Crime and Punishment, Catacombs, Crypts, &amp; CemeteriesLocation: Seoul, South KoreaEdited by: likethefox, Rachel, Dylan</div>

      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Lemp MansionAn historic house in St. Louis is reported to be haunted by a series of suicides committed by family members involved in a successful brewery.The story of the Lemp Mansion runs hand-in-hand with the story of German immigration and beer brewing in St. Louis. Johann "Adam" Lemp, a German immigrant, moved to St. Louis in 1838 and set up a grocery store in South St. Louis. By 1840 he was focusing primarily on brewing and selling beer. He formed Western Brewery, one of the first breweries to produce German Lager in the United States, at 37 South Second Street (where the south leg of the Arch now stands).
Adam's son, William J. Lemp, took over Western Brewery after serving as Orderly Sargeant for the Union in the American Civil War. Under William, the brewery grew to be the largest in St. Louis and the largest outside of New York with a single owner. 
William "Billy" J. Lemp Jr., William Sr.'s first son, followed the same educational path as his father, however it was William Sr.'s fourth son, Frederick, born in 1873, whom William Sr. hoped to groom to run the company. In 1876, William and his wife, Julia, moved into the Lemp Mansion (built in 1868). William changed the company to William J. Lemp brewing company in 1892 with his son William Jr. as Vice-President and his son Louis as Superintendent. It was now a family affair.
Unknown to the Lemp family, Frederick had significant health problems, and in 1901 Frederick died of heart failure. William Sr. became despondent and slowly deteriorated mentally and psychologically until he committed suicide by shotgun on February 13, 1904.
Billy took over after his father's death. His wife filed for divorce in 1908 charging Billy with desertion, cruel treatment, and other indignities. Billy was only granted visitation rights for their only son, William III. The company began to slide after prohibition, eventually shutting down and being auctioned for a minuscule fraction of its original worth. On December 29, 1922, Billy Lemp shot himself in his office. Today that office is the dining room of the mansion.
William Sr.'s youngest child, Elsa Lemp Wright, married Thomas Wright in 1910 and filed for divorce in 1919. They reconciled and were remarried in 1920, but she shot herself while in bed on March 20.
Charles Lemp, William Sr.'s third son, moved into the mansion in 1929. On April, 1941, Charles Lemp sent a letter to a south St. Louis funeral home requesting that in case of his death, his remains should be taken by ambulance to the Missouri Crematory. His body should not be bathed, clothed, or changed. His ashes should be put into a wicker box and buried on his farm. There were to be no funeral held or a notice put in the papers. On May 10, 1949 he shot his dog, then himself in the head, leaving the following note: "St. Louis Mo/May 9, 1949, In case I am found dead blame it on no one but me. Ch. A. Lemp".
That was the only suicide note in the family's history.
Edwin Lemp, the only remaining child of William Sr. (Louis died of natural causes in 1931), never moved back into the mansion. Edwin died in 1970 at age 90. His final order to his caretaker was to destroy his art collection and family heirlooms.
Today, the Lemp Mansion has been made into a restaurant and inn by the Pointer family and offers tours (historical and haunted), murder mystery dinner theatre, and Halloween parties.Read more about Lemp Mansion on Atlas Obscura...Category: Intriguing Environs, Eccentric HomesLocation: Edited by: salongmore, Rachel</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Arctic Siberian Campion Plant RevivedRussian researchers who have been excavating ancient squirrel burrows may have brought a 32,000 plant back to lifeOn the banks of the lower Kolyma River in the tundra of northeastern Siberia, an area that during the last ice age was the stomping grounds of mammoth and woolly rhinoceroses, there lived a vast community of tundra squirrels. These ancient squirrels, not unlike the creatures of today, would stockpile seeds in burrows to keep themselves alive through the increasingly unforgiving winters. Not too long after these particular burrows were created, they were covered up under 125 ft. of sediment by the brutal wind sweeping the earth, soon to be frozen at minus 7 degrees Celsius for 32,000 years.
Fast-forward to a few years ago, when Russian researchers found the fruit of a narrow-leaf campion -- a small, white arctic flower, within the burrows. According to the team, this fruit was exposed to just the right conditions to preserve cells that would facilitate awakening the plant from it's ancient slumber. While many are still skeptical, a firm radiocarbon date seems to back the claim.
If what the Russians say is true, then this dainty plant will weigh in as the oldest plant by quite a bit to have arisen from it's ancient tissue using its old DNA. The seeds attached to the placenta that was used to propagate the plants was allegedly carbon dated at 31,800 years old. If this finding is correct, scientists will have the ability to “study evolution in real-time” by comparing the specimens with the current living versions of the campion plant, as well as possibly propagating other species also found in the burrows, possibly bringing extinct specimens back from the dead.
The ancient campion specimen is currently being housed at the Russian Academy of Sciences research center at Pushchino, near Moscow.Read more about Arctic Siberian Campion Plant Revived on Atlas Obscura...Category: Natural Wonders, Extraordinary FloraLocation: Moscow, RussiaEdited by: Rachel, Seth Teicher</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Shwenandaw Kyaung TempleA grand example of 19th century Burmese teak architecture, and the most significant of Mandalay's historic buildings. The Shwenandaw Kyaung Temple, or Shwe-Kyaung-pyi as it is known to the Burmese, is the most significant of Mandalay's historic buildings, due to the fact that it is the sole remaining structure of the former wooden Royal Palace that was built by King Mindon in the mid-19th century. 
It was originally part of the royal palace complex in Amarapura, but was subsequently moved to Mandalay, where it became known as Mya Nan San Kyaw. Following its move, it became the northern section of the Glass Palace and also part of the king's royal apartments. It would also be the final home and resting place of King Mindon, who died in this structure in 1878. 
King Mindon's son Thibaw, who succeeded his father following his death, often used the building as meditation grounds, but became convinced that his father's spirit still haunted the grounds, so he immediately ordered the building to be dismantled and removed from the Royal City.
Over the course of the next 5 years following its dismantling, the building was reconstructed as a monastery and dedicated as a work of merit to the memory of King Mindon.
During the latter stages of World War II, the rest of the old Royal Palace within the old Royal City burned as a result of allied bombing of the Japanese encamped in the old Royal Palace. Due to King Thibaw's superstition and relocating of the building, he had preserved a significant remnant of the Royal Palace.Read more about Shwenandaw Kyaung Temple on Atlas Obscura...Category: Cultures and Civilizations , Architectural Oddities, Curious Places of WorshipLocation: Mandalay, MyanmarEdited by: TrevorShawnElia, Rachel</div>

Inaugurated in 1914 in the coastal town of Santos, the Brazilian "Palace of the Official Coffee Stock Exchange" was where the price of these coffee beans was determined. In effect, it was the financial center of Brazil, the coffee version of New York's Stock Exchange. It remained an active trading floor until 1950.
This wealth generated by coffee is clearly reflected in the grandness of the nicknamed "Coffee Palace." The building is topped with a 120-ft tall clock tower while Ceres, goddess of agriculture, and Mercury, god of commerce, look out from either side of the entrance. Inside, the opulence continues with an elaborate stained glass ceiling, inlaid marble floors, and a table made from jacaranda wood in the trader's room.

Inheriting a fortune in mining, and then later building up Pacific, Gas and Electric, now known as PG&amp;E. In fact he may have even been one of the richest men in the world when he built his grandiose town house in the posh neighborhood of Pacific Heights. 
Modest by Bourn's standards, this 27-room mansion was built in 1896 by Willis Polk. A masterpiece of the bricklayers' and stonemasons' arts, the mansion was only one of the elaborate buildings Bourn owned, the likes of which included palatial Empire Mine in Grass Valley, CA., and the Bourn's famous estate, Filoli in Woodside.
Despite it's classic, upper crust beginnings, the 70's were a crazy time in San Francisco, and the mansion saw it's share of debauchery. Purchased by eccentric Arden Van Upp, what was once a classy, Georgian-style home became a swinging party pad. The perfect place for lavish hedonism, the mansion was visited by rockstars, movie stars, porn stars, and overflowed with good drugs, fine wines, and sexual abandon. 
Eventually, the party ended, and like most narcissistic eccentrics, Arden Van Upp fell out of favor, while the house fell into disrepair. She became a shut in, her only companions her white Chinchilla Persian cats. Garbage piled up, as did the debt and the lawsuits. Eventually, Van Upp became bankrupt and the house was deemed uninhabitable. By 1998, the mansion was so decimated that the homeless people squatting inside had to move onto the yard.
The house was finally cleaned up and sold at auction in 2010, and despite assessments that repair would cost quite a bit more than the house is worth, it remains a Historical Landmark and still stands at 2550 Webster Street. Locals who are attached to the mansion with the hard-luck story are hoping that the new owners are willing to restore it's former beauty, despite the cost.Read more about Bourn Mansion on Atlas Obscura...Category: Architectural OdditiesLocation: Edited by: rebeccaclara, Rachel, Dylan</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Berlin Botanical GardenStarted as a kitchen garden, now the second largest botanical garden in the worldEstablished as a kitchen garden in 1679, the Botanical Garden in Berlin is the second largest botanical garden in the world, second only to Kew Gardens, located in England.
The garden evolved from a kitchen garden growing vegetables and hops for beer brewing to a “considerable plant assemblage,” and in 1879 the Royal Botanical Museum was founded, encompassing every area of botany.
The sheer size of the gardens and the lush density of the plant life is overwhelming, especially when taking into account that so many of these plants are endangered in their natural habitats. What grows strong and vibrant in this collection is often threatened with extinction elsewhere. This assembly of gardens, sixteen greenhouses, and landscapes exhibit a microcosm of nature's diversity, home to flowered vines, rock cliff waterfalls, timber bamboo reaching to the sky, and a carpet of ferns, orchids, and bromeliads at your feet.
The Victoria House delivers a proper tropical environment with sweltering humidity that the orchids and lilies love, a bamboo bridge that transports you over the basin and into an exotic plant paradise. 
With 43 hectares and close to 22,000 plant species, one visit won't even come close to allowing you to see everything. Make sure you make the most of your day there and don't miss the Great Pavillion, which at 20 meters high and 30x60 meters in floor area is the largest glass house in the world. 
Other must see displays include the giant water lilies, carnivorous plant specimens, and a small cemetery, located to the left of the green house complex when coming from access at the Königin-Luise-Platz. Keep a look out for the sarcophagus of Friedrich Althoff, a university tutor deceased in 1908, which consists of a dolorous female figure meant to represent science in mourning.
Also of interest, but currently not open to the public (or anyone for that matter) is a series of tunnels built near the Botanical Gardens in WWII. Entrance to the bunker was through two tunnels leading from the farm of the botanical garden. Built for the SS to house personal and files during air raids, after the war the entrances were blown up, and the tunnels now serve as a winter roost for bats.Read more about Berlin Botanical Garden on Atlas Obscura...Category: Extraordinary Flora, Natural History, Horticultural MarvelsLocation: Berlin, GermanyEdited by: Rachel, Dylan</div>

Doran Memorial Bridge. The house, playfully nicknamed by Bay Area residents as The Flintstone House is actually an experimental house built in 1976, with rooms in which every surface is rounded. Beneath its burnt orange (originally white) coat of paint is a slew of cement, rebar, plaster putty, wire mesh and aeronautical balloons.
The house looks somewhat like a series of inflated balloons, which makes sense, as this was how it was constructed. Steel rebar and wire mesh frames were constructed over large inflated balloons and then sprayed with high velocity concrete known as  gunite or "shotcrete."
This building technique, known as "monolithic dome construction" was invented by the South brothers in Shelly, Idaho in 1975. One year later, Bay Area architect William Nicholson built a series of domes using this method, including The Flintstone House in Hillsborough, California. 
The home, which is also referred to as the Dome House, Gumby House and Bubble House, is a three-bedroom, two-bath house with a two-car garage and about 2,700 square feet of living space. The upstairs bedroom, located in the tallest dome, has a spiral staircase inspired by a sugar-cone with a diameter that increases to equal that of the floor above. The master bathroom is also unique with its scattering of large rocks in place of floor tiles.
While The Flintstone House is marveled by many passerby, it is also loathed by many Hillsborough residents. In the mid-1980s the home began to show serious wear as water runoff on the steep hillside caused the home to sink and the walls began to develop deep cracks. Word spread of such problems and several neighbors pushed to have the home removed. However, to their dismay, a severe renovation and change in ownership brought the home back to life in 1987. It took on its characteristic "Flintstone" look when it was painted completely orange in 2000. 
Today, The Flintstone House is as well known for its architecture as it is for its sporadic tenants, which has led to several urban legends surrounding the home's ownership. It is rumored that George Lucas once owned and that O.J. Simpson made a bid following his infamous 1995 trial. It is also said that several famous Sillicon Valley investors have lived there as well.
Regardless of ownership and neighborhood complaints, The Flintstone House remains standing. Overlooking the freeway and reservoir, it continues to serve as an unofficial California landmark and lighthearted reminder of the Bay Area’s forward, yet sometimes quirky, thinking.Read more about The Flintstone House on Atlas Obscura...Category: Eccentric Homes, Outsider ArchitectureLocation: Edited by: Duck_Muscle, Rachel, Dylan</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">The Enchanted ForestThe Enchanted Forest is an old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800 year old cedars. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes. During the 1950s, they cleared trails and constructed rock walls over 8 acres with nothing but hand tools. Ernest built them a little home that looked a bit like a gingerbread house, and installed a gravity water system using the waterfall across the highway, which is still in use today.
When Roger's Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needhams' unusual haven, and in 1960 they decided to officially open up their Enchanted Forest to the public. What was once just a project they enjoyed together to invent their own happy place for their retirement was now a highly popular tourist spot for sightseers. One could not drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house belonging to the couple that created it all.
By 1970, a million people had stopped to visit the castle and marvel at the statues and tree houses and all the other surprises nestled in the Needhams' forest. The couple realized that it had become unmanageable, and their retirement idea had turned into a challenging full time job. Wanting to enjoy the fruits of their labor before it was too late, Doris and Ernest sold their forest to Rocky and Juliet Ehlers and their children, Aza, Silas and Naomi. 
Fortunately, the Ehlers loved the Enchanted Forest for what it was, and have continued to care for it and keep it available to visitors. The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage with ferns growing on the roof, or a favorite nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest treehouse in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.Read more about The Enchanted Forest on Atlas Obscura...Category: Strange Statues, Follies and Grottoes, Outsider ArchitectureLocation: Edited by: elinar, Rachel, Seth Teicher</div>

All the mosaics are donated by the community.. At the very top is the moon (the stairs ascend from "sea Level" to the moon--get it?). There's also another garden at the bottom and one of the last crops of Franciscan formation at the top (it has its own biozone!).</p>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Underground Tunnels of Los AngelesDuring prohibition, corrupt (or “fun” depending on how you look at it) city officials ran prohibition dens under the streets of Downtown Los Angeles. 
While the rest of the country was forced to go dry, underneath Downtown Los Angeles the party never stopped. Despite prohibition laws, eleven miles of service tunnels became passageways to basement speakeasies with innocuous fronts above ground. Patrons were able to move about under the city, boozing it up without a care in the world, while the Mayor's office ran the supply of hootch.
King Eddy Saloon, an establishment that has been alive and kicking on 5th and Main since the 1900's, hid in plain sight fronting as a piano store - a suspicious business to be in during the depression. Luckily, local officials took no issue with King Eddy's sudden interest in music, and the business not only survived but prospered. Now an official saloon once more, its basement still remains part of the tunnel system, littered with crumbling brick lines and graffiti murals.
Aside from the service tunnels, there are also abandoned subway and equestrian tunnels from the days before personal vehicles began clogging up L.A.'s city streets. There are stories of these tunnels being used by police to transport prisoners, bank security to move large sums of cash safely, and both coroners and mobsters to store bodies. Now they are mostly closed off, but some are still accessible and are used as film locations, easy shortcuts by city employees between buildings, and a place for runners to train on the rare occasion of bad weather.
To explore the former highway of the L.A. Underground, you must slip behind the Hall of Records on Temple St. and locate an easy-to-miss elevator. You’ll be transported down into a subterranean passage filled with mysterious street art, rusted machinery, and iron gates that limit your exploration to areas deemed earthquake safe.Read more about Underground Tunnels of Los Angeles on Atlas Obscura...Category: Architectural Oddities, Subterranean SitesLocation: Edited by: Rachel, Seth Teicher, Dylan</div>

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Athena the Owl at the Florence Nightingale MuseumThe Florence Nightingale Museum is home to the famous nurse's most treasured belonging, her beloved pet owlAt the Parthenon in Athens, Greece in 1850, a tiny owlet fell from its nest and into the hands of wicked children. The tiny bird was spotted by a young woman who, sure it was about to be tortured to death by the rascals, saved the baby bird. It was the bird's extreme luck that young woman happened to be none other than Florence Nightingale, the British nurse whose name is now synonymous with the word “mercy.”
Ms. Nightingale shooed off the offending youths and rescued the poor owlet, who she named Athena after the Greek goddess of war and wisdom. True to her nature, the nurse lovingly cared for Athena, hand-feeding her, training her to bow and curtsy, and tucking her safely in the pocket of her apron. Athena responded with a fierce loyalty. On occasion, a little too fierce. Athena was not fond of people she found intrusive to her human, and often used her impressive beak to peck at those who dared to get within reach.
After 5 years of blissful owl/nurse companionship, war broke out in Crimea and Florence was called on to take her nursing skills into the field. A war zone is no place for a pet, even one as intelligent and devoted as Athena, so Florence arranged for her feathered friend to reside in her attic during her absence. Unfortunately, the tender loving care that had saved Athena's life when she was just a baby was the very thing that ultimately led to her demise. Too domesticated to hunt for herself and devastated by loneliness, Athena perished in the attic when family members failed to check on her. 
Florence, who had been busy preparing to leave but had not yet departed, was heartbroken. Not willing to part with her dear friend so quickly, she delayed her trip and found a trusted taxidermist to preserve Athena forever. She kept the feathery shell of her beloved pet mounted in her family home for the rest of her days.

<h3>Athena the Owl at the Florence Nightingale Museum</h3>
<b>The Florence Nightingale Museum is home to the famous nurse's most treasured belonging, her beloved pet owl</b><p>At the Parthenon in Athens, Greece in 1850, a tiny owlet fell from its nest and into the hands of wicked children. The tiny bird was spotted by a young woman who, sure it was about to be tortured to death by the rascals, saved the baby bird. It was the bird's extreme luck that young woman happened to be none other than Florence Nightingale, the British nurse whose name is now synonymous with the word “mercy.”<br>
Ms. Nightingale shooed off the offending youths and rescued the poor owlet, who she named Athena after the Greek goddess of war and wisdom. True to her nature, the nurse lovingly cared for Athena, hand-feeding her, training her to bow and curtsy, and tucking her safely in the pocket of her apron. Athena responded with a fierce loyalty. On occasion, a little too fierce. Athena was not fond of people she found intrusive to her human, and often used her impressive beak to peck at those who dared to get within reach.<br>
After 5 years of blissful owl/nurse companionship, war broke out in Crimea and Florence was called on to take her nursing skills into the field. A war zone is no place for a pet, even one as intelligent and devoted as Athena, so Florence arranged for her feathered friend to reside in her attic during her absence. Unfortunately, the tender loving care that had saved Athena's life when she was just a baby was the very thing that ultimately led to her demise. Too domesticated to hunt for herself and devastated by loneliness, Athena perished in the attic when family members failed to check on her. <br>
Florence, who had been busy preparing to leave but had not yet departed, was heartbroken. Not willing to part with her dear friend so quickly, she delayed her trip and found a trusted taxidermist to preserve Athena forever. She kept the feathery shell of her beloved pet mounted in her family home for the rest of her days. When Florence went to join Athena in the great beyond, the owl was displayed in the home of wealthy sister Parthenope, who wrote a book about her with the title, “The Life and Death of Athena an Owlet”.<br>
Later on the owl fell into the care of an elderly care charity by the name Age Care, which also owned “Lea Hurst”, Nightingale's family home. The trust loaned the owl and other artifacts to the Florence Nightingale Museum, and when the items were put up for sale, a community fundraiser effort was successful in making the museum Athena's permanent home.</p>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Site of the NianticGold Rush ship-turned-hotel buried underneath San Francisco's financial districtThe story of the Niantic is that of a ship made rich, abandoned, remade, burned, buried, lost, re-found, and then lost again. It has had a full history.
The Niantic was one of many ships that brought eager gold-seekers from around the world into Yerba Buena Cove (now San Francisco) during the frenzied times of 1848-1849. 
Originally a whaling ship, the amount of money to be made ferrying gold hungry hopefuls to Yerba Buena Cove was staggering, and the Niantic made over 38,000 dollars - over a million dollars in today's money - on its single trip bringing gold seekers to California. Upon arrival in Yerba Buena, the aspiring miners would abandon the ships, stock up on supplies, and race out to take their chances panning for gold in the foothills. 
The Niantic, however, had an unusual fate. It wasn't just the passengers that were eager to try their luck in the gold game, and on the first day five of the crew deserted, nine more left on the second day, and three more took off on the third. (It may have been about more than just gold, as two of the deserting sailors stabbed their Captain as part of their farewell.)
The ship, left with almost no crew, was simply floated out of the busy bay and purposely run aground near what is now the intersection Clay and Montgomery Streets.
The ship was subsequently converted for use as a store, warehouse, offices, and hotel. Most of the ship burned in several fires starting in 1850, but was each time was rebuilt into a novelty hotel that incorporated the ship's original hull. Above the door cut into the vessels side was the inscription "Rest for the weary and storage for trunks."
The famous hotel stood until 1872 when it burned down, though in the remains the forgotten hull of the ship - with a bunch of champagne inside - was re-discovered in the ruins. The hull was then promptly forgotten again. The hull of the Niantic was then once again "rediscovered" in 1978 during excavation for the Mark Twain Plaza Complex. She still had some champagne left in her hold. 
Today a portion of the ship is in the San Francisco maritime museum while a bow remains undisturbed under a parking lot, awaiting a future "rediscovery." The Niantic is only one of over a hundred ships now buried somewhere under San Francisco's shoreline. 
In 1919, the Historic Landmarks Committee of the Native Sons of the Golden West put up a plaque to mark the site.Read more about Site of the Niantic on Atlas Obscura...Category: Subterranean SitesLocation: Edited by: rebeccaclara, Dylan, cwhaley1981, Seth Teicher</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Thinker's Lodge in Pugwash, Nova ScotiaA rustic house where intellectuals and investors tried to put an end to Cold War nuclear armament Cyrus Eaton, a famed investor and philanthropist of the early 20th century, made his money as a powerful financier in the American Midwest.  However, he hailed from the humble beginnings of Pugwash, a tiny fishing community on the Northern shore of Nova Scotia.  
Known for his charitable and progressive attitude, it was no surprise that he readily offered his old home in Pugwash to a burgeoning alliance of intellectuals and scientists. Their simple goal; to ease the tightening detente of the Cold War in the 1950's and onward, and for good measure, nuclear disarmament. This group was affiliated with the famous Russell-Einstein Manifesto -- a groundbreaking petition co-authored by the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the eminent freethinking scientist Albert Einstein -- and was actually co-founded by Bertrand Russell himself.
It was to Cyrus Eaton's humble family abode on the North Shore that this group went to seek reconciliation and had a brainstorming session on one of the most threatening problems facing mankind.  The initial meeting had various countries and ideologies present; 7 American, 3 Soviet, 3 Japanese, 3 British, 2 Canadian, an Australian, an Austrian, a Chinese, a French, and finally a Polish scientist.  Amongst the scientists were also Eaton himself, and a small smattering of other power holders.  After the small session in Nova Scotia, an organization was founded called "The Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs."
The aforementioned organization, in present day, has this impressive list of accomplishments: the Nobel Peace Prize (1995), as well as claims of influence on the Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963), the Non-Proliferation Treaty (1968), the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (1972), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), and the Chemical Weapons Convention (1993). It's hard to believe that ideas spread in a tiny house in a small town could have such international relevance!

Built by Dr. Seward Webb and Lila Vanderbilt Webb (yes, one of those Vanderbilts) in 1886, the once lavish summer home has evolved into a fully sustainable, non-for-profit teaching farm populated by Brown Swiss cows, piglets, and baby goats.
While the farm’s inn is as beautiful and bed-and-breakfasty as can be, what makes Shelburne a truly worthwhile destination is its grounds: 1,400 acres of stunning farmland, with twisting trails that were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect most famous for designing Central Park. Tour guides claim that Olmsted designed Shelburne’s grounds with the intentions of surprising visitors at every turn and invoking a sense of wonder and mystique as they traveled around the farm. He seems to have accomplished his mission, as the farm’s terrain shifts from rolling hills and picturesque pastures to sandy shores and dense forests at every bend.
The Inn at Shelburne Farms is closed from October to March due to a lack of heating- during World War II the entire inn (including the furnace) was stripped of its metal for the war effort. The inn is also rumored to be haunted by the late Mrs. Webb, so plan any overnight trips accordingly.
If you somehow manage to get burnt out on petting cows, tasting (award-winning) cheese, and wandering around the miles of walking trails, you can just kick back in the inn’s gardens and look out over the water.

      	<div class="entry_summary">Meserole TheatreHistoric Greenpoint theater housing a generic pharmacyThe Meserole was a silent movie house opened in 1921. It was named after one of the original farming families that settled Greenpoint in the 1700s. Unfortunately, that pioneering spirit has disappeared, as it is now home to a Rite Aid pharmacy.
After being bought by United Artists, the theater modernized and switched to talkies. This lasted until the 1980s, when it made another fashionable transformation: roller disco. As the fad died out, the space became a 99-cent store, then an Eckard Drug, finally being bought out by Rite Aid. 
Luckily, the pharmacy chain left much of theatre’s layout intact. The exterior was left untouched, except for the clashing Rite Aid sign affixed to it. Inside, there is a huge centrally-located white dome that holds a disco ball from its boogie oogie oogie days. Elsewhere there are elaborately detailed arches and moldings that have been whitewashed as well.
The theater might be resuscitated in 2014, when the pharmacy’s lease is up. Landlord, Geoffrey Bailey, has put it out there that if Rite Aid does not renew its lease, it would be nice to have the Meserole returned to its former glory.Read more about Meserole Theatre on Atlas Obscura...Category: Architectural OdditiesLocation: Edited by: HJHausman, Rachel</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">The National Toy Hall of Fame A collection of the best toys ever made, The National Toy Hall of Fame is filled with kids, fun, and for some reason, a bird preserve.What do GI Joes, Duncan Yo-Yos, and sticks have in common? Answer: They have all been inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame! 
Located on the top floor of the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, it's a great place to bring kids and enjoy your own youth, as well, but be forewarned: As it's at the Museum of Play, the whole museum doubles as a children's play area. It's nosy and there's a constant threat of a child running into you. 
Established in 1998, it's original home was in Salem, Oregon before moving to Rochester and the Museum of Play in 2002. Since 1998, 49 toys have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
The first class included 17 toys: Barbie, Crayola Crayon, Erector Set, Etch-A-Sketch, Frisbee, Hula Hoop, Legos, Lincoln Logs, Marbles, Monopoly, Play-Doh, Radio Flyer wagon, Roller Skates, Teddy Bear, Tinkertoys, View-master, Duncan Yo-Yo. In 2011, the inductees were the dollhouse, Hot Wheels, and the blanket. 
If you think your favorite toy is missing from the hall of fame, you can nominate it and it will be considered for next year's class!  Nominated toys are selected on the basis of criteria, which includes icon-status, longevity, discovery, and innovation. Inductions are held every November, so get your entries in early!
In addition to the National Toy Hall of Fame, the Museum of Play also houses an awesome retrospective video game exhibit, a bird perserve, and an old diner.  A great day trip!Read more about The National Toy Hall of Fame  on Atlas Obscura...Category: Museums and Collections, Unique CollectionsLocation: Edited by: OrangeRavens, Rachel</div>
