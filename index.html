      	<div class="entry_summary">Sir Richard Burton's Tent-Tomb Eclectic final resting place of the controversial explorerIn the quiet churchyard of St. Mary Magdalen's catholic Church, an expedition-style tent marks the final resting place of Richard Francis Burton and his doting wife, Isabel Arundell. The eclectic design reflects Burton's life-long fascination with all things Arabian, but also incorporates Catholic symbolism important to his devout wife. Not quite a Bedouin or Arab design, the shape of the mausoleum is believed to be based on the tent that the Burtons shared during their stay in Syria. Through a small window in the back (which can be reached by climbing the attached ladder), their side-by-side caskets are still visible.
Burton was a renowned explorer of the Victorian age, a celebrated linguist and writer, and a scandalous translator of naughty exotic books. As a young man expelled from Oxford for horse racing, he enlisted with the army of the East India Company where he honed his gift for languages by learning several local dialects of Hindi, as well as Persian and Arabic. Ultimately he was said to have mastered some 29 languages. His first taste of fame came from his 1853 infiltration of Mecca in disguise. He solidified that fame in later years during his African expeditions for the Royal Geographical Society, pushing into the interior of the continent in search of the source of the Nile River.
in 1861 he married Isabel Arundell, who was to spend her married years awaiting his return from far flung adventures or following him to the edges of the map. The couple lived together in Brazil, in Damascus, Syria, and finally in Trieste, Italy, where Richard translated and published his most famous and scandalous works: "The Kama Sutra," "The Arabian Nights," and "The Perfumed Garden." Now widely considered to be erotic masterpieces, at the time they were received as pornography - although not without some enthusiasm from readers of a certain persuasion.
After Richard's death in 1890, Isabel famously burned many of his papers and at least one manuscript (another translation of "The Perfumed Garden"), an act she defended as being done to protect his reputation and legacy, but for which history has not quite forgiven her. In accord with his final wishes, she had his unique tent-shaped mausoleum built, with a stained glass window installed so visitors can look in and view the coffins inside. She also donated the Burton Memorial Window inside the church, somewhat entertainingly depicting three saints and the man who quipped, "the more I study religions the more I am convinced that man never worshiped anything but himself" dressed as a Christian Knight at prayer.

      	<div class="entry_summary">Pasaquan: Home of St. EOMThe artistic creation of the strange and mysterious St. EOM, a.k.a. Eddie Owens MartinAt one point in the late 1950s, during an extended and fever-ridden illness, Eddie Owens Martin experienced the first of a series of phenomenal visions that would drive his artistic efforts for the rest of his life. 
In the initial vision, he was confronted by a trio of extraordinarily tall personages who identified themselves as people of the future—special envoys from a vaporous land called Pasaquan, "where the past, the present, the future, and everything else all come together." 
He had been chosen by them, he later reported, to help us attain an understanding of the peace and beauty that the future might hold for mankind, if mankind would only take heed. On that day, Eddie Owens Martin of Marion County, Georgia, became, at least to himself, St. EOM - the one and only Pasaquoyan of the twentieth century.
Eddie Owens Martin left home at the young age of fourteen, after he saw his father kill a puppy that had been given to him as a gift. Eddie eventually settled in New York, working as "a male prostitute and minor-league hustler," and becoming a fixture of the emerging Greenwich Village arts scene, where he was nicknamed the Tattooed Countess. It was here that Eddie experienced his visions. Among the messages about "how to ritually prepare for the proper conduct of his personal daily existence" was that he was to "return to Georgia and do something." 
That something is Pasaquan, an artistic environment built over thirty years, made of painted concrete sculptures and four acres (16,000 square meters) of painted masonry concrete walls. Pasaquan also includes six buildings, including a redesigned 1885 farmhouse. Inspired by his visions and smoking "a fat one" (a joint) Martin (or "Big Mama" as he known by locals in Buena Vista) single-handedly created an amazing, religiously symbol-laden, sometimes beautiful and sometimes lewd arts environment. After working on Pasaquan right up until illness made it impossible, Martin, at the age of 77, laid out an African chieftain's robe that he wished to be buried in and shot himself.
In his own words, Martin or St. EOM said of Pasaquan:
"I built this place to have somethin' to identify with, cause there's nothin' that I see in this society that I identify with or desire to emulate. Here I can be in my own world with my temples and designs and the spirit of God. I don't have nothin' against other people and their beliefs.  I'm not askin' anybody to do my way or be my way. Although, when I'm dead and gone, they'll follow like night follows day." 
Of course he also said:
"There's no place like this anywhere, and people will come and deface it when I die, and then everything I've done will be forgotten."
It remains to be seen which vision is the correct one.Read more about Pasaquan: Home of St. EOM on Atlas Obscura...Category: Museums and Collections, Outsider Art, Architectural Oddities, Eccentric Homes, Outsider ArchitectureLocation: Georgia, USEdited by: wythe, Rachel</div>

      	<div class="entry_title">Boiling Lake</div>
      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Boiling LakeThis mountaintop lake bubbles and steams in a perpetual boil, thanks to its direct link to the Earth's molten coreThere’s nothing quite like a secluded lake. Passing through a thicket of trees or over a rugged trail, and suddenly catching a glimpse of that clear blue water, its surface sparkling like glass in the hot sun, and sipping the cool, refreshing water from the mountain springs that feed it. Or, on a particularly hot summer day, jumping headlong into it for a jolt of cold refreshment from head to toe.
A mountain lake like that is universal in its appeal, and Dominica is no different. Except in one spot.
In one particularly odd basin, pooled high atop Watt Mountain in Morne Trois Pitons National Park, the water simply isn’t that refreshing. In fact, it’s boiling hot. And while ‘boiling hot’ is a common phrase used for hyperbole, visitors should not test the veracity of this claim -- drinking or bathing in this water will result in death, or at least severe burns.
Not that most visitors would be tempted to do such a thing. A thick cloud of balmy steam emanates from and surrounds the menacing lake, leaving no question as to how hot the water really is. But if that alone isn’t convincing enough, the swirling, bubbling maelstrom of churning water at the lake’s center confirm without a doubt that the water has been brought to a boil.

<h3>Boiling Lake</h3>
<b>This mountaintop lake bubbles and steams in a perpetual boil, thanks to its direct link to the Earth's molten core</b><p>There’s nothing quite like a secluded lake. Passing through a thicket of trees or over a rugged trail, and suddenly catching a glimpse of that clear blue water, its surface sparkling like glass in the hot sun, and sipping the cool, refreshing water from the mountain springs that feed it. Or, on a particularly hot summer day, jumping headlong into it for a jolt of cold refreshment from head to toe.<br>
A mountain lake like that is universal in its appeal, and Dominica is no different. Except in one spot.<br>
In one particularly odd basin, pooled high atop Watt Mountain in Morne Trois Pitons National Park, the water simply isn’t that refreshing. In fact, it’s boiling hot. And while ‘boiling hot’ is a common phrase used for hyperbole, visitors should not test the veracity of this claim -- drinking or bathing in this water will result in death, or at least severe burns.<br>
Not that most visitors would be tempted to do such a thing. A thick cloud of balmy steam emanates from and surrounds the menacing lake, leaving no question as to how hot the water really is. But if that alone isn’t convincing enough, the swirling, bubbling maelstrom of churning water at the lake’s center confirm without a doubt that the water has been brought to a boil.<br>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Mono LakeAqueducts have dramatically changed this old lake, now home to tufa towers and its very own species of tiny brine shrimpMono Lake is believed to have formed 760,000 years ago, making it one of the oldest lakes in North America. Researchers estimate that at the time of the last ice age, the lake was 900 feet deep and surrounded by large volcanoes. Islands in the lake were known as important nesting sites, and it is believed that 85% of California Gulls started their life there. All that changed, however, in 1941, when the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power built an aqueduct and began diverting the lake's water 300 miles south.
So much water was diverted that the rate of evaporation far exceeded the inflow. Subsequently, the lake's surface level decreased to half its depth while the saline levels doubled. By 1962, the lake had lost almost 25 vertical feet and its ecosystems began to crumble. The nesting beds became accessible to predators, mostly coyotes, and the famous California gulls were forced to abandon the site.
As the surface level dropped, it also exposed alkaline sands and odd-shaped tufa towers that had laid hidden for years. The tufa towers, which have since made the lake popular among tourists, are calcium-carbonate structures that form from underground springs. The calcium and carbonate mix to form limestone and builds up over time to create the 30-foot tall spire structures that can be seen today.
The lake was almost left to ruin until 1978, when David Gaines assembled the Mono Lake Committee and began spreading awareness about the urgent state of the area. A decade later, Gaines and his colleague, Don Oberlin, were killed on site in a winter automobile accident. Despite this tragedy, the committee has continued to fight to preserve the area, now known as an important ecological and geological site for researchers.
Though the lake's hypersalinity and alkalinity levels make it impossible for fish to survive there, the area is home to a species of brine shrimp, Artemia monica, found nowhere else in the world. The brine shrimp -- roughly the size of a thumbnail -- lay dormant during winter months, but 4-6 trillion brine shrimp surface by spring time and early summer.
The tiny species of brine shrimp, as well as alkali flies, feed off even tinier species of microscopic, single-celled planktonic algae. The green algae reproduces rapidly during the winter months, and by March the lake is said to look "as green as pea soup." Like any food chain, however, both shrimp and flies alike become a delicacy to millions of birds that flock to the area year round. Every fall, 1.5 million Eared Grebes stop to feast at Mono Lake during their long migrations.
Although the landscape has dramatically changed -- and though the water levels still remain below the historic record -- Mono Lake has one of the most productive ecosystems in the world and is a geological hotbed for researchers. Located in the Mono Basin, the area is the center of much seismic activity, and is flanked by volcanic rock formations that are 1-3 million years old. Such formations include the Mono Craters, 24 domes of explosive rhyolite that forms the youngest volcanic chain in North America.
Today, the Mono Lake Committee suspects that it will take roughly 20 years before the water will return to 6,392 feet above sea level, the Water Board-ordered stabilization level. Even then, the salt levels will be twice as concentrated as the ocean.Read more about Mono Lake on Atlas Obscura...Category: Natural Wonders, Watery Wonders, Martian Landscapes, Geological Oddities, Fascinating Fauna, Wonders of SaltLocation: Edited by: anhie, Deryn, Rachel</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Big DuckA former poultry store that looks like a giant duck and is one of the "seven wonders" of Long IslandThis giant duck-shaped poultry store was built in 1931 as a ploy by an enterprising farmer, Martin Maurer, to sell more ducks and duck eggs. Not only did it succeed in selling more waterfowl, but it has become one of Long Island's leading landmarks. The duck is now located in a park and has a gift shop inside.
There are several interesting elements in the duck's history.  The duck's eyes give away its age and are in fact headlights of a Model T Ford. The structure was also featured in an Atlas Cement catalog although the majority of the duck was built with a different type of cement. The duck has been moved several times, first to be nearer to the owner's duck farm and again by Suffolk County, before finally returning to Flanders. 
The duck is also responsible for an interesting bit of architectural lingo: Robert Venturi coined the term "duck" to describe a building that conforms to its purpose, in deference to the Big Duck. It was named one of the seven Wonders of Long Island by a local radio station.Read more about Big Duck on Atlas Obscura...Category: Eccentric Homes, Outsider ArchitectureLocation: Edited by: greg, Dylan, Henry, AllisonEng, Rachel</div>

<h3>Big Duck</h3>
<b>A former poultry store that looks like a giant duck and is one of the "seven wonders" of Long Island</b><p>This giant duck-shaped poultry store was built in 1931 as a ploy by an enterprising farmer, Martin Maurer, to sell more ducks and duck eggs. Not only did it succeed in selling more waterfowl, but it has become one of Long Island's leading landmarks. The duck is now located in a park and has a gift shop inside.<br>
There are several interesting elements in the duck's history.  The duck's eyes give away its age and are in fact headlights of a Model T Ford. The structure was also featured in an Atlas Cement catalog although the majority of the duck was built with a different type of cement. The duck has been moved several times, first to be nearer to the owner's duck farm and again by Suffolk County, before finally returning to Flanders. <br>

The lake was formed after an earthquake in 1911, which caused a major landslide, effectively creating a natural dam. Successively, rainwater filled the valley and created the lake.
The lake is famous for the number of dead and bleached spruce trees that stick out of the water – remnants of the trees that were flooded when the lake was formed. The trees, together with the improbable turquoise water of the lake, make an incredibly scenic sight. Underwater, the imagery is even more stunning, as the trees have not decomposed and create the surreal vision of an underwater forest.
Surprisingly, the lake sees few visitors, partly because Kaindy Lake is overshadowed by the more famous Bolshoe Almatinskoe Lake and the Kolsay Lakes, all of which are close by, but far easier to reach from Almaty. Thus, despite its proximity to a city with a population of more than one million, the lake retains a peaceful atmosphere.Read more about Kaindy Lake on Atlas Obscura...Category: Natural Wonders, Watery Wonders, Geological OdditiesLocation: Mogila Malay, KazakhstanEdited by: Tawsam, Rachel</div>

It is possible that no human had set foot in this cave until its discovery in 1924 by one of the local Terena Indians who, as far as it is known, had not been aware of the beautiful cave's existence. The cave is a part of one of the largest flooded cavities on the planet. 
Called the Gruta Do Lago Azul, or the Blue Lake Grotto, the large cave is filled with a pool of astonishingly clear blue water. Thought to be over 200 feet deep, the water turns a particularly beautiful blue when sunlight shines through a hole in the ceiling of the cave, and makes the water shimmer in the light. It is believed that the lake is fed by an underground river yet to be located.
In 1992, a Franco-Brazilian expedition went cave diving and found a surprise: thousands of prehistoric animal bones - giant mammals from the Pleistocene era -- lay on the bottom of the grotto. From saber tooth tigers to giant sloths, the underwater site is tremendously rich in giant mammal fossils.Read more about Gruta Do Lago Azul: The Blue Lake Grotto on Atlas Obscura...Category: Natural Wonders, Watery Wonders, Curious CavesLocation: Edited by: Dylan, Annetta, gabeschwartz, Rachel</div>

At other points, it's more like quicksand. And dotted throughout are breaks in its continuity, revealing water below – not unlike a lake frozen for winter.
It's the surface of Pitch Lake, which is exactly what it sounds like: A lake "made of" pitch. And in most places, it's nearly solid, allowing fascinated visitors to walk along its strange, often unsettling surface.
A more accurate description is that Pitch Lake is a basin in the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago that collects both water and pitch, resulting in a somewhat unreal mixture of the two, at times as thin as regular lakewater, and at others as hard as a rock. Debris such as boulders, fallen trees, and refuse often get caught in the sticky surface, resulting in impromptu works of art as well as warning signs of the lake's actual danger, as the pitch hardens around the object and effectively turns it to stone.
This doesn't stop daring travelers from walking along the surface of the lake, jabbing sticks and rocks into the clingy goo that forms the more stable areas, or even taking a plunge in the open "pools" of water that often form at crevices in the semi-continuous pitch. Long known by locals to be a strange place, Pitch Lake has picked up a bit of a reputation as a tourist attraction, with off-the-beaten-path travelers coming to examine one of the strangest lakes on the planet.Read more about Pitch Lake on Atlas Obscura...Category: Natural Wonders, Watery Wonders, Martian Landscapes, Geological Oddities, Intriguing EnvironsLocation: Edited by: Mark_Casey, Rachel</div>

Six deep blue lakes suddenly appear like sparkling jewels in the middle of the barren grey wasteland of Central Afghanistan that stretches as far the eye can see. The lakes’ waters are composed of a high mineral content, which is responsible for the deep blue colour of the lakes. 
Travertine walls between and around the lakes have created natural dams, that store the rainwater, which flows from the cracks and fissures of the surrounding rocks. Around the shore of the lake Band-e Haibat the travertine walls reach a height of twelve meters, creating an otherworldy effect of some sort of natural infinity pool. The overspilling water of the lake creates small waterfalls along the outer rim of the travertine walls.
According to local legend, the lakes were formed as the result of a series of miracles performed by Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed, which left the local king so amazed that he immediately decided to convert to Islam. A shrine to Ali to honour his miraculous works stands on the shore of one of the lakes.
If one day the tourism industry in Afghanistan gets going, the Band-e Amir lakes are likely to become the country’s prime tourist attraction. Even today, the lakes are a favorite destination for day trips, and they exude an often joyful and almost festive atmosphere – a rarity in Afghanistan, which makes the lakes popular among locals and expats alike. This atmosphere at the lakes is a unique reminder of the days when Afghanistan was firmly placed on the tourist map, as the country was part of the famous Hippie Trail from Istanbul to Northern India.
In 2009, the country's first national park was created around the vicinity of the lakes. While still open to visitors, there is harsh terrain, mined unpaved roads, and no real basic facilities. Only a thin track of road is safe to travel on, so adventure wisely.Read more about Band-e Amir Lakes on Atlas Obscura...Category: Natural Wonders, Watery Wonders, Martian Landscapes, Geological OdditiesLocation: Band-e Amir, IranEdited by: Tawsam, Rachel, pfasta</div>
