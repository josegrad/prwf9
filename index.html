      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">The Enchanted ForestThe Enchanted Forest is an old world fairytale-land with over 350 fairy folk figurines hidden amongst 800 year old cedars. Artist Doris Needham and her husband Ernest needed a place to put her hand-sculpted cement creations, so they bought a forest and filled it with enchanted figures from fairytales and nursery rhymes. During the 50's, they cleared trails and constructed rock walls over 8 acres with nothing but hand tools. Ernest built them a little home that looked a bit like a gingerbread house, and installed a gravity water system using the waterfall across the highway, which is still in use today.
When Roger's Pass opened, traffic began being diverted through the Needham's unusual haven, and in 1960 they decided to officially open up their Enchanted Forest to the public. What was once just a project they enjoyed together to invent their own happy place for their retirement was now a highly popular tourist spot for sightseers. One could not drive by and resist dragons and pirates lurking on boulders and behind trees, dwarves and fairies sharing the pools at the foot of waterfalls, or the adorable Candy Cane house belonging to the couple that created it all.
By 1970, a million people had stopped to visit the castle and marvel at the statues and tree houses and all the other surprises nestled in the Needham's forest. The couple realized that it had become unmanageable, and their retirement idea had turned into a challenging full time job. Wanting to enjoy the fruits of their labor before it was too late, Doris and Ernest sold their forest to  Rocky and Juliet Ehlers and their children, Aza, Silas and Naomi. 
Fortunately, the Ehlers loved the Enchanted Forest for what it was, and have continued to care for it and keep it available to visitors. The forest is full of twists and turns, each corner revealing a new small cottage with ferns growing on the roof, or a favorite nursery character sitting on a wall, full of whimsy. They boast over 350 figurines, a pirate ship, and the tallest treehouse in British Columbia. The forest itself is a beautiful site, with beaver ponds for boating, 800 year-old cedars, salmon spawning and moose and caribou sightings during migration months.Read more about The Enchanted Forest on Atlas Obscura...Category: Strange Statues, Follies and Grottoes, Outsider ArchitectureLocation: Edited by: elinar, Rachel</div>

To get to Red Bay, one must travel up the western coast of Newfoundland, a pleasure in itself, and then travel by ferry to the Quebec/Labrador border.  
Once there, an astounding drive through pine trees and jagged rocks will deposit you in a fog-shrouded village called Red Bay.  
Red Bay in itself doesn't boast much, interesting box like houses, few roads, but the town's mystique comes from its natural beauty and its history. Red Bay is quite literally a sheltered bay, surrounded with rocks and hills. From the coast, icebergs dance by, and in the distance, the lucky can spot the flumes of whale pods.  The town has an anachronistic feel to it, with an aura that has stood still for centuries.  
It was in this natural bay that the Spanish sought shelter, between 400-500 years ago.  The Basques, from Southern France and Northern Spain, sent whalers to this remote location hoping to catch the Right and the Bowhead whales.  In 1565, a Spanish whaling ship sank off the coast of Red Bay.  A further three "trans-oceanic" ships have been discovered off the coast of Red Bay, and a cemetery nearby holds the remains of 140 whalers.

      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Underground Tunnels of Los AngelesDuring prohibition, corrupt (or “fun” depending on how you look at it) city officials ran prohibition dens under the streets of Downtown Los Angeles. 
While the rest of the country was forced to go dry, underneath Downtown Los Angeles the party never stopped. Despite prohibition laws, eleven miles of service tunnels became passageways to basement speakeasies with innocuous fronts above ground. Patrons were able to move about under the city, boozing it up without a care in the world, while the Mayor's office ran the supply of hootch.
King Eddy Saloon, an establishment that has been alive and kicking on 5th and Main since the 1900's, hid in plain sight fronting as a piano store - a suspicious business to be in during the depression. Luckily, local officials took no issue with King Eddy's sudden interest in music, and the business not only survived but prospered. Now an official saloon once more, its basement still remains part of the tunnel system, littered with crumbling brick lines and graffiti murals.
Aside from the service tunnels, there are also abandoned subway and equestrian tunnels from the days before personal vehicles began clogging up L.A.'s city streets. There are stories of these tunnels being used by police to transport prisoners, bank security to move large sums of cash safely, and both coroners and mobsters to store bodies.

<h3>Underground Tunnels of Los Angeles</h3>
<b>During prohibition, corrupt (or “fun” depending on how you look at it) city officials ran prohibition dens under the streets of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</b><p>While the rest of the country was forced to go dry, underneath Downtown Los Angeles the party never stopped. Despite prohibition laws, eleven miles of service tunnels became passageways to basement speakeasies with innocuous fronts above ground. Patrons were able to move about under the city, boozing it up without a care in the world, while the Mayor's office ran the supply of hootch.<br>
King Eddy Saloon, an establishment that has been alive and kicking on 5th and Main since the 1900's, hid in plain sight fronting as a piano store - a suspicious business to be in during the depression. Luckily, local officials took no issue with King Eddy's sudden interest in music, and the business not only survived but prospered. Now an official saloon once more, its basement still remains part of the tunnel system, littered with crumbling brick lines and graffiti murals.<br>
Aside from the service tunnels, there are also abandoned subway and equestrian tunnels from the days before personal vehicles began clogging up L.A.'s city streets. There are stories of these tunnels being used by police to transport prisoners, bank security to move large sums of cash safely, and both coroners and mobsters to store bodies. Now they are mostly closed off, but some are still accessible and are used as film locations, easy shortcuts by city employees between buildings, and a place for runners to train on the rare occasion of bad weather.<br>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Athena the Owl at the Florence Nightingale MuseumThe Florence Nightingale Museum is home to the famous nurse's most treasured belonging, her beloved pet owlAt the Parthenon in Athens, Greece in 1850, a tiny owlet fell from its nest and into the hands of wicked children. The tiny bird was spotted by a young woman who, sure it was about to be tortured to death by the rascals, saved the baby bird. It was the bird's extreme luck that young woman happened to be none other than Florence Nightingale, the British nurse whose name is now synonymous with the word “mercy.”
Ms. Nightingale shooed off the offending youths and rescued the poor owlet, who she named Athena after the Greek goddess of war and wisdom. True to her nature, the nurse lovingly cared for Athena, hand-feeding her, training her to bow and curtsy, and tucking her safely in the pocket of her apron. Athena responded with a fierce loyalty. On occasion, a little too fierce. Athena was not fond of people she found intrusive to her human, and often used her impressive beak to peck at those who dared to get within reach.
After 5 years of blissful owl/nurse companionship, war broke out in Crimea and Florence was called on to take her nursing skills into the field. A war zone is no place for a pet, even one as intelligent and devoted as Athena, so Florence arranged for her feathered friend to reside in her attic during her absence. Unfortunately, the tender loving care that had saved Athena's life when she was just a baby was the very thing that ultimately led to her demise. Too domesticated to hunt for herself and devastated by loneliness, Athena perished in the attic when family members failed to check on her. 
Florence, who had been busy preparing to leave but had not yet departed, was heartbroken. Not willing to part with her dear friend so quickly, she delayed her trip and found a trusted taxidermist to preserve Athena forever. She kept the feathery shell of her beloved pet mounted in her family home for the rest of her days. When Florence went to join Athena in the great beyond, the owl was displayed in the home of wealthy sister Parthenope, who wrote a book about her with the title, “The Life and Death of Athena an Owlet”.
Later on the owl fell into the care of an elderly care charity by the name Age Care, which also owned “Lea Hurst”, Nightingale's family home. The trust loaned the owl and other artifacts to the Florence Nightingale Museum, and when the items were put up for sale, a community fundraiser effort was successful in making the museum Athena's permanent home.Read more about Athena the Owl at the Florence Nightingale Museum on Atlas Obscura...Category: Fascinating Fauna, Museums and Collections, Unique Collections, Hunting and TaxidermyLocation: London, United KingdomEdited by: Rachel, Annetta, Dylan</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Site of the NianticGold Rush ship-turned-hotel buried underneath San Francisco's financial districtThe story of the Niantic is that of a ship made rich, abandoned, remade, burned, buried, lost, re-found, and then lost again. It has had a full history.
The Niantic was one of many ships that brought eager gold-seekers from around the world into Yerba Buena Cove (now San Francisco) during the frenzied times of 1848-1849. 
Originally a whaling ship, the amount of money to be made ferrying gold hungry hopefuls to Yerba Buena Cove was staggering, and the Niantic made over 38,000 dollars - over a million dollars in today's money - on its single trip bringing gold seekers to California. Upon arrival in Yerba Buena, the aspiring miners would abandon the ships, stock up on supplies, and race out to take their chances panning for gold in the foothills. 
The Niantic, however, had an unusual fate. It wasn't just the passengers that were eager to try their luck in the gold game, and on the first day five of the crew deserted, nine more left on the second day, and three more took off on the third. (It may have been about more than just gold, as two of the deserting sailors stabbed their Captain as part of their farewell.)
The ship, left with almost no crew, was simply floated out of the busy bay and purposely run aground near what is now the intersection Clay and Montgomery Streets.
The ship was subsequently converted for use as a store, warehouse, offices, and hotel. Most of the ship burned in several fires starting in 1850, but was each time was rebuilt into a novelty hotel that incorporated the ship's original hull. Above the door cut into the vessels side was the inscription "Rest for the weary and storage for trunks."
The famous hotel stood until 1872 when it burned down, though in the remains the forgotten hull of the ship - with a bunch of champagne inside - was re-discovered in the ruins. The hull was then promptly forgotten again. The hull of the Niantic was then once again "rediscovered" in 1978 during excavation for the Mark Twain Plaza Complex. She still had some champagne left in her hold. 
Today a portion of the ship is in the San Francisco maritime museum while a bow remains undisturbed under a parking lot, awaiting a future "rediscovery." The Niantic is only one of over a hundred ships now buried somewhere under San Francisco's shoreline. 
In 1919, the Historic Landmarks Committee of the Native Sons of the Golden West put up a plaque to mark the site.Read more about Site of the Niantic on Atlas Obscura...Category: Subterranean SitesLocation: Edited by: rebeccaclara, Dylan, cwhaley1981, Seth Teicher</div>

Known for his charitable and progressive attitude, it was no surprise that he readily offered his old home in Pugwash to a burgeoning alliance of intellectuals and scientists. Their simple goal; to ease the tightening detente of the Cold War in the 1950's and onward, and for good measure, nuclear disarmament. This group was affiliated with the famous Russell-Einstein Manifesto -- a groundbreaking petition co-authored by the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the eminent freethinking scientist Albert Einstein -- and was actually co-founded by Bertrand Russell himself.
It was to Cyrus Eaton's humble family abode on the North Shore that this group went to seek reconciliation and had a brainstorming session on one of the most threatening problems facing mankind.  The initial meeting had various countries and ideologies present; 7 American, 3 Soviet, 3 Japanese, 3 British, 2 Canadian, an Australian, an Austrian, a Chinese, a French, and finally a Polish scientist.  Amongst the scientists were also Eaton himself, and a small smattering of other power holders.  After the small session in Nova Scotia, an organization was founded called "The Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs."
The aforementioned organization, in present day, has this impressive list of accomplishments: the Nobel Peace Prize (1995), as well as claims of influence on the Partial Test Ban Treaty (1963), the Non-Proliferation Treaty (1968), the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (1972), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), and the Chemical Weapons Convention (1993). It's hard to believe that ideas spread in a tiny house in a small town could have such international relevance!

      	<div class="entry_summary">Shelburne FarmsA massive sustainable farm designed by the mastermind behind Central ParkFifteen minutes outside of Burlington, Vermont, nestled between Lake Champlain and Route 89 lies Shelburne Farms, a place far worthier of a visit than the average roadside rural destination. Built by Dr. Seward Webb and Lila Vanderbilt Webb (yes, one of those Vanderbilts) in 1886, the once lavish summer home has evolved into a fully sustainable, non-for-profit teaching farm populated by Brown Swiss cows, piglets, and baby goats.
While the farm’s inn is as beautiful and bed-and-breakfasty as can be, what makes Shelburne a truly worthwhile destination is its grounds: 1,400 acres of stunning farmland, with twisting trails that were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect most famous for designing Central Park. Tour guides claim that Olmsted designed Shelburne’s grounds with the intentions of surprising visitors at every turn and invoking a sense of wonder and mystique as they traveled around the farm. He seems to have accomplished his mission, as the farm’s terrain shifts from rolling hills and picturesque pastures to sandy shores and dense forests at every bend.
The Inn at Shelburne Farms is closed from October to March due to a lack of heating- during World War II the entire inn (including the furnace) was stripped of its metal for the war effort. The inn is also rumored to be haunted by the late Mrs. Webb, so plan any overnight trips accordingly.
If you somehow manage to get burnt out on petting cows, tasting (award-winning) cheese, and wandering around the miles of walking trails, you can just kick back in the inn’s gardens and look out over the water. Hopefully you’ll get lucky, and spot Champ- Lake Champlain’s very own version of Nessie- popping his head out of the water.Read more about Shelburne Farms on Atlas Obscura...Category: Natural Wonders, Architectural OdditiesLocation: Edited by: MichaeltheMagic, Dylan</div>

It was named after one of the original farming families that settled Greenpoint in the 1700s. Unfortunately, that pioneering spirit has disappeared, as it is now home to a Rite Aid pharmacy.
After being bought by United Artists, the theater modernized and switched to talkies. This lasted until the 1980s, when it made another fashionable transformation: roller disco. As the fad died out, the space became a 99-cent store, then an Eckard Drug, finally being bought out by Rite Aid. 
Luckily, the pharmacy chain left much of theatre’s layout intact. The exterior was left untouched, except for the clashing Rite Aid sign affixed to it. Inside, there is a huge centrally-located white dome that holds a disco ball from its boogie oogie oogie days. Elsewhere there are elaborately detailed arches and moldings that have been whitewashed as well.
The theater might be resuscitated in 2014, when the pharmacy’s lease is up.

Answer: They have all been inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame! 
Located on the top floor of the Strong Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, it's a great place to bring kids and enjoy your own youth, as well, but be forewarned: As it's at the Museum of Play, the whole museum doubles as a children's play area. It's nosy and there's a constant threat of a child running into you. 
Established in 1998, it's original home was in Salem, Oregon before moving to Rochester and the Museum of Play in 2002. Since 1998, 49 toys have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. 
The first class included 17 toys: Barbie, Crayola Crayon, Erector Set, Etch-A-Sketch, Frisbee, Hula Hoop, Legos, Lincoln Logs, Marbles, Monopoly, Play-Doh, Radio Flyer wagon, Roller Skates, Teddy Bear, Tinkertoys, View-master, Duncan Yo-Yo. In 2011, the inductees were the dollhouse, Hot Wheels, and the blanket. 
If you think your favorite toy is missing from the hall of fame, you can nominate it and it will be considered for next year's class!  Nominated toys are selected on the basis of criteria, which includes icon-status, longevity, discovery, and innovation. Inductions are held every November, so get your entries in early!
In addition to the National Toy Hall of Fame, the Museum of Play also houses an awesome retrospective video game exhibit, a bird perserve, and an old diner.

The thundering trumpet of an elephant herd sauntering along the coastline, watchful mothers guarding their calves that frolic in the surf of the Atlantic Ocean. How about a hippopotamus caught among the waves and surfing to the shore? If this sounds impossible, you've never been  to Loango National Park, 'Africa's Last Eden'. 
Situated between the Nkomi and Ndogo Lagoons, Loango National Park is home to a stunning diversity of habitats within its 1,550 km range, from savannas to 100 km of pristine, unoccupied beaches; from seemingly untouched virgin rain forests to the serpentine bends and gnarls of mangrove forests, Loango offers many sights for any true nature lover. 
Loango National Park also includes part of the 220 km² Iguéla Lagoon, the only significant example of a typical western African lagoon system that is protected entirely within a national park.
For animal lovers, Loango National Park is a true paradise on earth. Gabon holds one of the highest densities of wildlife in the world, and Loango National Park proudly shows off its bountiful harvest to the world: forest elephants, hippos, red forest buffalo, leopards, crocodiles, western lowland gorillas, chimpanzees, sitatunga, duikers, a vast array of birds, a variety of different monkey species, and the world's largest concentration of humpback whales and dolphins after South Africa.

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Ni'ihau IncidentA kamikaze pilot crash lands on Ni'ihau after Pearl Harbor attack and terrorizes locals for a week When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7th, 1941, the island of Ni'ihau was inhabited by a mere 136 souls, most of which were native Hawaiians. Out of those who weren't, three happened to be of Japanese descent, two of which were born on Ni'ihau. Because of the island's small size and significant isolation, the Imperial Japanese Navy mistakenly characterized the area as uninhabited, and designated it as a place to crash land and/or rendezvous with a rescue sub after the onslaught.
Airman First Class Shigenori Nishikaichi's plane was damaged after taking part in the second wave of the attack, and as he had been instructed, crash landed on the deserted Ni'ihau. Much to his surprise he was approached by a Ni'ihau resident who had been standing 19 ft. away, and who while unaware of the attack on Pearl Harbor, knew enough about current events to relieve Nishikaichi of his weapon and his papers.
Unable to communicate with the pilot and confused about his presence, the Japanese-speaking residents were summoned. Yoshio Harada, who was Japanese but Hawaiian born, was brought in along with his wife Irene to find out why the pilot was there. After a terse conversation in which Nishikaichi informed the two of the Pearl Harbor attack, Harada chose to keep the info to himself, and asked if the pilot could be relocated to his house until someone from the main island came to fetch him.
The absence of electricity and telephones on the island delayed news of the fate of Pearl Harbor, but a radio transmission alerted the people of Ni'ihau to the gravity of the  presence of their prisoner eventually, and Nishikaichi knew that his lax security among these gentle and welcoming people would soon come to an end. Employing the help of the Haradas as well as the only other Japanese citizen on the island, Ishimatsu Shintani, he overpowered the guards, retrieved his weapon, and took a 16 year-old girl as a hostage.
For the next several days, Nishikaichi and his converts terrorized the island in a mission to retrieve the pilot's papers, which Hawila Kaleohano, the man who had originally confiscated them, stubbornly refused to surrender. Women and children ran for caves and distant beaches as the men played an armed version of cat and mouse, Kaleohano hiding the papers with a relative and then setting out to get help as Nishikaichi frantically torched his plane and tore the island inside-out looking for his vital papers.
Finally, on December 13th, 6 days after the madness had begun, it abruptly ended. Harada and Nishikaichi, desperate to find the papers, took Ben Kanahele and his wife hostage and ordered them to find Kaleohano. Aware that Kaleohano had left the island, Ben Kanahele played along. Noticing the exhaustion of his captors, he watched and waited for the perfect opportunity to pounce. At the earliest distraction, Kanahele and his wife Ella sprung into action, and despite getting shot three times, he managed to overpower Nishikaichi long enough for Ella to smash his head in with a rock. Harada, upon realizing his new leader was dead and his treason would be exposed, turned his shotgun on himself as Kanahele finished off the enemy pilot by slitting his throat.
 The privately-owned island of Ni'ihau is still fairly isolated to this day, open primarily to residents, their invited guests, and military personnel, giving it the nickname “The Forbidden Isle”. Since 1987, it has allowed limited tourism and supervised excursions on it's shores. The remains of Nishikaichi's Zero can be viewed on permanent display at the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor on Ford Island in Pearl Harbor.Read more about Ni'ihau Incident on Atlas Obscura...Category: Anomalous Islands, Crime and PunishmentLocation: Hawaii, USEdited by: Rachel</div>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Visiting one of the oldest living organisms in the world is actually quite easy.  Thought to be the eighth oldest tree in the world, the Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) affectionately known as the “Senator,” stands in a small park located in Longwood, FL. 
Its estimated age of 3,500 years makes it only slightly younger than the carefully guarded Great Basin Bristlecone Pine of California known as Methuselah. To get a good sense of how old this tree really is, one must keep in mind the “Senator” was alive not only during the time of Jesus, but for 1500 years before that when the Greeks destroyed Troy, the Olmecs were powerful in Mexico, Solomon succeeded King David, and Stonehenge was being constructed. Unlike the secret location of the ancient pine, this cypress is very accessible to the public.
The “Senator” is the largest tree east of the Mississippi and currently stands at 118 feet tall with a circumference of 35 feet.  A hurricane in 1925 damaged the top of the tree, shortening it from its original height of 165 feet.he tremendous size of the tree made it useful to both Indians and early settlers as a marker when traveling through the area.  Tourists have frequented the area to view the tree since the 1800’s and the land on which it resides was donated to Seminole County by the late Senator M.O. Overstreet to ensure the preservation of the tree.  It was in memory of Senator Overstreet that the cypress received its present name.  Following the donation in 1927, a ceremony hosted by President Calvin Coolidge, officially opened the property to the public in 1929.
Surrounded today by the Spring Hammock Preserve, the “Senator” shares space with a companion tree known as “Lady Liberty.” This companion Bald Cypress is a comparatively youthful 2,000 years old and stands 89 feet in height with a circumference of 32 feet.Read more about The Senator, Bald Cypress on Atlas Obscura...Category: Horticultural MarvelsLocation: Longwood, Florida, USEdited by: ronin, Dylan, Gumbotronic, Rachel</div>

Apparently she left the fire burning, and the tree was engulfed days later, burning from the inside out. Though the park is still open, the tree is no longer standing. Original article below:<br>

Visiting one of the oldest living organisms in the world is actually quite easy.  Thought to be the eighth oldest tree in the world, the Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) affectionately known as the “Senator,” stands in a small park located in Longwood, FL. <br>
Its estimated age of 3,500 years makes it only slightly younger than the carefully guarded Great Basin Bristlecone Pine of California known as Methuselah. To get a good sense of how old this tree really is, one must keep in mind the “Senator” was alive not only during the time of Jesus, but for 1500 years before that when the Greeks destroyed Troy, the Olmecs were powerful in Mexico, Solomon succeeded King David, and Stonehenge was being constructed. Unlike the secret location of the ancient pine, this cypress is very accessible to the public.<br>
The “Senator” is the largest tree east of the Mississippi and currently stands at 118 feet tall with a circumference of 35 feet.  A hurricane in 1925 damaged the top of the tree, shortening it from its original height of 165 feet.<br><br>he tremendous size of the tree made it useful to both Indians and early settlers as a marker when traveling through the area.  Tourists have frequented the area to view the tree since the 1800’s and the land on which it resides was donated to Seminole County by the late Senator M.O. Overstreet to ensure the preservation of the tree.  It was in memory of Senator Overstreet that the cypress received its present name.  Following the donation in 1927, a ceremony hosted by President Calvin Coolidge, officially opened the property to the public in 1929.<br>
Surrounded today by the Spring Hammock Preserve, the “Senator” shares space with a companion tree known as “Lady Liberty.” This companion Bald Cypress is a comparatively youthful 2,000 years old and stands 89 feet in height with a circumference of 32 feet.</p>

For nine years, Hachikō waited for the train every day, only to leave alone. Commuters and station employees would feed him treats and keep him company, and an old student of the professor retraced the dog's genealogy, declaring Hachikō as one of only 30 purebred Akitas remaining.

Behind the nondescript wall, a guard tower looms, and below it, a grim gate. This gate marks the entrance to Seodaemun Prison, a relic from a forgotten era in Korea's past seeped in subjugation and humiliation.  
Seodaemun Prison was opened in 1908 by occupying Japanese forces in an attempt to impose order on the newly acquired territory. Prior, the country had a virtually non-existent penal system, and the introduction of Seodaemun Prison was a precursor to full out occupation.  
Seodaemun became a bastion for the Korean independence movement from its opening in 1908 until the liberation of the country in 1945. As the Japanese arrested more patriots, the prison's notoriety increased and it eventually became a symbol of perseverance. Many patriots died in custody, were tortured to death, or were executed within the prison's walls. The macabre execution hall still stands, housing the prison's gallows (with a tunnel nearby to dispose of corpses).
Throughout the preserved prison-turned-museum, you can see chillingly recreated torture chambers, jail cells, isolation cells, and more. The women's section has been preserved, basement cells in which no privacy was afforded.  Some of the torture chambers have frighteningly realistic mannequins and effigies to famous Korean patriots who died within the prison.
Designated as a historic site in 1988 and renovated in 1995, Seodaemun is an interesting place to visit for those who want a tactile experience of the Japanese occupation and the horrors entailed. It stands out amongst Seoul's other historic sites as a monument to those who helped shape the modern Korean nation.Read more about Seodaemun Prison on Atlas Obscura...Category: Crime and Punishment, Catacombs, Crypts, &amp; CemeteriesLocation: Seoul, South KoreaEdited by: likethefox, Rachel</div>

She favored barefeet, flowing clothing, loose hair, and free form movements. Her communist leanings and unconventional - some might say scandalous-- love life made her a controversial figure. She has since appeared in pop culture, including a 1968 film in which she was portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave. 
The plaque at 501 Taylor Street on Lower Nob Hill, near the Theater District in San Francisco commemorates Isadora Duncan's place of birth, but she is also famous for the circumstances of her death. While riding in a convertible in Nice, France in 1927, her long scarf, a signature accessory she was known for, became caught in the wheel of the car. She was ripped out of the vehicle by her neck and dragged several yards before the chauffeur was able to stop. Her death was officially caused by strangulation, however it's said she was almost decapitated by the fashion statement she just couldn't live without.
Coincidentally, years earlier her children were tragically and avoidably killed in a motor vehicle. After being seated in a car on a hill, the driverless vehicle began to roll, and plunged over a bridge and into the Seine, where the children perished along with a nanny that was accompanying them.Read more about Birthplace of Isadora Duncan on Atlas Obscura...Category: Wondrous Performances, Eccentric HomesLocation: Edited by: rebeccaclara, Rachel, sfpaperboy</div>

She has since appeared in pop culture, including a 1968 film in which she was portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave. <br>
The plaque at 501 Taylor Street on Lower Nob Hill, near the Theater District in San Francisco commemorates Isadora Duncan's place of birth, but she is also famous for the circumstances of her death. While riding in a convertible in Nice, France in 1927, her long scarf, a signature accessory she was known for, became caught in the wheel of the car. She was ripped out of the vehicle by her neck and dragged several yards before the chauffeur was able to stop. Her death was officially caused by strangulation, however it's said she was almost decapitated by the fashion statement she just couldn't live without.<br>
Coincidentally, years earlier her children were tragically and avoidably killed in a motor vehicle. After being seated in a car on a hill, the driverless vehicle began to roll, and plunged over a bridge and into the Seine, where the children perished along with a nanny that was accompanying them.</p>

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Lemp MansionAn historic house in St. Louis is reported to be haunted by a series of suicides committed by family members involved in a successful brewery.The story of the Lemp Mansion runs hand-in-hand with the story of German immigration and beer brewing in St. Louis. Johann "Adam" Lemp, a German immigrant, moved to St. Louis in 1838 and set up a grocery store in South St. Louis. By 1840 he was focusing primarily on brewing and selling beer. He formed Western Brewery, one of the first breweries to produce German Lager in the United States, at 37 South Second Street (where the south leg of the Arch now stands).
Adam's son, William J. Lemp, took over Western Brewery after serving as Orderly Sargeant for the Union in the American Civil War. Under William, the brewery grew to be the largest in St. Louis and the largest outside of New York with a single owner. 
William "Billy" J. Lemp Jr., William Sr.'s first son, followed the same educational path as his father, however it was William Sr.'s fourth son, Frederick, born in 1873, whom William Sr. hoped to groom to run the company. In 1876, William and his wife, Julia, moved into the Lemp Mansion (built in 1868). William changed the company to William J. Lemp brewing company in 1892 with his son William Jr. as Vice-President and his son Louis as Superintendent. It was now a family affair.
Unknown to the Lemp family, Frederick had significant health problems, and in 1901 Frederick died of heart failure. William Sr. became despondent and slowly deteriorated mentally and psychologically until he committed suicide by shotgun on February 13, 1904.
Billy took over after his father's death. His wife filed for divorce in 1908 charging Billy with desertion, cruel treatment, and other indignities. Billy was only granted visitation rights for their only son, William III. The company began to slide after prohibition, eventually shutting down and being auctioned for a minuscule fraction of its original worth. On December 29, 1922, Billy Lemp shot himself in his office. Today that office is the dining room of the mansion.
William Sr.'s youngest child, Elsa Lemp Wright, married Thomas Wright in 1910 and filed for divorce in 1919. They reconciled and were remarried in 1920, but she shot herself while in bed on March 20.
Charles Lemp, William Sr.'s third son, moved into the mansion in 1929. On April, 1941, Charles Lemp sent a letter to a south St. Louis funeral home requesting that in case of his death, his remains should be taken by ambulance to the Missouri Crematory. His body should not be bathed, clothed, or changed. His ashes should be put into a wicker box and buried on his farm. There were to be no funeral held or a notice put in the papers. On May 10, 1949 he shot his dog, then himself in the head, leaving the following note: "St. Louis Mo/May 9, 1949, In case I am found dead blame it on no one but me. Ch. A. Lemp".
That was the only suicide note in the family's history.
Edwin Lemp, the only remaining child of William Sr. (Louis died of natural causes in 1931), never moved back into the mansion. Edwin died in 1970 at age 90. His final order to his caretaker was to destroy his art collection and family heirlooms.
Today, the Lemp Mansion has been made into a restaurant and inn by the Pointer family and offers tours (historical and haunted), murder mystery dinner theatre, and Halloween parties.Read more about Lemp Mansion on Atlas Obscura...Category: Intriguing Environs, Eccentric HomesLocation: Lake Saint Louis, Missouri, USEdited by: salongmore, Rachel</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Arctic Siberian Campion Plant RevivedRussian researchers who have been excavating ancient squirrel burrows may have brought a 32,000 plant back to lifeOn the banks of the lower Kolyma River in the tundra of northeastern Siberia, an area that during the last ice age was the stomping grounds of mammoth and woolly rhinoceroses, there lived a vast community of tundra squirrels. These ancient squirrels, not unlike the creatures of today, would stockpile seeds in burrows to keep themselves alive through the increasingly unforgiving winters. Not too long after these particular burrows were created, they were covered up under 125 ft. of sediment by the brutal wind sweeping the earth, soon to be frozen at minus 7 degrees Celsius for 32,000 years.
Fast-forward to a few years ago, when Russian researchers found the fruit of a narrow-leaf campion -- a small, white arctic flower, within the burrows. According to the team, this fruit was exposed to just the right conditions to preserve cells that would facilitate awakening the plant from it's ancient slumber. While many are still skeptical, a firm radiocarbon date seems to back the claim.
If what the Russians say is true, then this dainty plant will weigh in as the oldest plant by quite a bit to have arisen from it's ancient tissue using its old DNA. The seeds attached to the placenta that was used to propagate the plants was allegedly carbon dated at 31,800 years old. If this finding is correct, scientists will have the ability to “study evolution in real-time” by comparing the specimens with the current living versions of the campion plant, as well as possibly propagating other species also found in the burrows, possibly bringing extinct specimens back from the dead.
The ancient campion specimen is currently being housed at the Russian Academy of Sciences research center at Pushchino, near Moscow.Read more about Arctic Siberian Campion Plant Revived on Atlas Obscura...Category: Natural Wonders, Extraordinary FloraLocation: Moscow, RussiaEdited by: Rachel, Seth Teicher</div>

The Shwenandaw Kyaung Temple, or Shwe-Kyaung-pyi as it is known to the Burmese, is the most significant of Mandalay's historic buildings, due to the fact that it is the sole remaining structure of the former wooden Royal Palace that was built by King Mindon in the mid-19th century. 
It was originally part of the royal palace complex in Amarapura, but was subsequently moved to Mandalay, where it became known as Mya Nan San Kyaw. Following its move, it became the northern section of the Glass Palace and also part of the king's royal apartments. It would also be the final home and resting place of King Mindon, who died in this structure in 1878. 
King Mindon's son Thibaw, who succeeded his father following his death, often used the building as meditation grounds, but became convinced that his father's spirit still haunted the grounds, so he immediately ordered the building to be dismantled and removed from the Royal City.
Over the course of the next 5 years following its dismantling, the building was reconstructed as a monastery and dedicated as a work of merit to the memory of King Mindon.
During the latter stages of World War II, the rest of the old Royal Palace within the old Royal City burned as a result of allied bombing of the Japanese encamped in the old Royal Palace.

      	<div class="entry_summary">Tobin HouseHalf of a houseBuilt by Michael De Young-- founder of the San Francisco Chronicle-- for his daughter, Constance, the Tobin house was to be the first half of a pair. Built for the wealthy magnates daughters, his daughters, one of them at least, had other plans.
Designed in 1915 by prominent architect Willis Polk in Tudor Gothic Revival style, the house was next to the original site of Michael De Young's estate.

<h3>Tobin House</h3>
<b>Half of a house</b><p>Built by Michael De Young-- founder of the San Francisco Chronicle-- for his daughter, Constance, the Tobin house was to be the first half of a pair. Built for the wealthy magnates daughters, his daughters, one of them at least, had other plans.<br>
Designed in 1915 by prominent architect Willis Polk in Tudor Gothic Revival style, the house was next to the original site of Michael De Young's estate. De Young designed the two houses to be mirror images of each other, and the side of the house features a large archway that was meant to be complemented, and completed, by the neighboring house. <br>
However, while Constance was happy to live in the house, his daughter Helen de Young had other plans, and said, "Thanks, but no, thanks, Dad." The second half of the mirror image house was never built leaving the archway ending abruptly where it meets the next building.</p>

Eastman was also an avid explorer and huntsman. He would go on regular safaris to Africa, bagging himself elephants, rhinos, and antelope. He would then would use the taxidermied animals as decorations, ashtrays, and umbrella holders, which are all on display. (The elephant head is a facsimile based on a plaster cast of the original.

It sat there in almost complete anonymity for over a century. In 1999, it was moved to the nearby, Blessed St John Duns Scotus, where it has been given a place of honor at the church’s entrance. Every Valentine’s Day, it is decorated with flowers while the friars say prayers for lovers. It has even led Glasgow to label itself the “City of Love.”
Little is really known of the real man (or men) behind the myth. What is known (more or less) is that at least two men by the name of Valentine (Valentinus) were known in Italy and died in the late 3rd century, and a third Valentine was located in North Africa around the same time. The two Italians were buried along Via Flaminia. As a saint, Valentine first gained real notoriety in 496 when Pope Gelasius I made February 14, originally part of the Roman festival of Lupercalia, a feast day dedicated to St. Valentine. The stories of the different men seem to have merged into one over time, with most of the mythology about Valentine being a patron of lovers, helping early Christian couples to marry in secret, only dating to the 14th century and the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer. 
Today, there are no less than ten places claiming to house the relics, all around the world, including the Basilica of Santa Maria in Rome,  Roquemaure, France,  and Dublin, Ireland.Read more about St. Valentine’s Bones, Glasgow on Atlas Obscura...Category: Memento Mori, Relics and ReliquariesLocation: Glasgow, United KingdomEdited by: HJHausman, Rachel, Annetta</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Relics of Saint Valentine at the Whitefriar Street ChurchThe remains of one of the many St. Valentines resides in Dublin, Ireland.John Sprat was an Irish Carmelite that was known for his abilities as a preacher and dedicated work with the destitute in the city of Dublin. While visiting Rome, his fame had apparently preceded him, and he became hot on the Jesuit circuit, giving sermons and receiving tokens of esteem from his peers.
One of the more impressive tokens he was gifted were the remains of Saint Valentine by Pope Gregory XVI, which had recently been uncovered during grave restorations. Sprat brought the Reliquary containing the relics to his Whitefriar Street Church in Dublin, where they remained popular until the death of their popular procurer. With the death of Sprat, the relics went into storage and were not venerated until the church went through restorations in the 1950's/1960's. An altar and shrine were created and are now watched over by a statue  depicting the saint holding a crocus, carved by Irene Broe.
Today the shrine is popular with couples who come to pray for St. Valentine to watch over their lives together and to celebrate the feast day of February 14th which includes the Blessings of the Rings for those about to marry. The Reliquary is placed on the high altar and venerated at the Masses. 
So what does this particular collection of St. Valentine relics contain? According to an inscription on a gold plate attached to the casket: This shrine contains the sacred body of Saint Valentinus the Martyr, together with a small vessel tinged with his blood.
More specifically, the Reliquary contains “some” of his remains, never claiming to have all of them, and a small vessel tinged with his blood-all of which is contained within a small, wax-sealed box with a red silk ribbon around it. This box is located in the casket, which is occasionally opened to check on the contents. The smaller box remains sealed.Read more about Relics of Saint Valentine at the Whitefriar Street Church on Atlas Obscura...Category: Relics and ReliquariesLocation: Dublin, IrelandEdited by: Rachel</div>

With the death of Sprat, the relics went into storage and were not venerated until the church went through restorations in the 1950's/1960's. An altar and shrine were created and are now watched over by a statue  depicting the saint holding a crocus, carved by Irene Broe.<br>
Today the shrine is popular with couples who come to pray for St. Valentine to watch over their lives together and to celebrate the feast day of February 14th which includes the Blessings of the Rings for those about to marry. The Reliquary is placed on the high altar and venerated at the Masses. <br>
So what does this particular collection of St. Valentine relics contain? According to an inscription on a gold plate attached to the casket: This shrine contains the sacred body of Saint Valentinus the Martyr, together with a small vessel tinged with his blood.<br>
More specifically, the Reliquary contains “some” of his remains, never claiming to have all of them, and a small vessel tinged with his blood-all of which is contained within a small, wax-sealed box with a red silk ribbon around it. This box is located in the casket, which is occasionally opened to check on the contents. The smaller box remains sealed.</p>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Skull bits of St. Valentine in ChelmnoA silver reliquary holds what may or may not be parts of the martyr's skull Preserved in a small silver reliquary in a parish church in Chelmno, a bit of bone is revered as the skull of St. Valentine, patron saint of lovers (as well as bee keepers and epilepsy, among other things). 
The relics have been in the possession of the church for "several hundred years" and are the focal point of the city's annual celebrations on February 14. The only problem is that his skull is inconveniently  already on display in Rome. 
The silver reliquary dates to around 1630, and was described in 1880 as follows: “...it is the saint’s head, or rather a small fragment of it. The relic is placed in an octagonal reliquary which is made of silver, is one foot high and weighs about three pounds. On top of it there is a round dome-shaped lid where the relic is kept and where it can be seen and kissed through the glass. The relic is the size of about two fingers.”
An altar devoted to the saint sits next to the main altar, separating the main nave from the south one, decorated with a painting of the martyr’s decapitation. 
Little is really known of the real man (or men) behind the myth. What is known (more or less) is that at least two men by the name of Valentine (Valentinus) were known in Italy and died in the late 3rd century, and a third Valentine was located in North Africa around the same time. The two Italians were buried along Via Flaminia. As a saint, Valentine first gained real notoriety in 496 when Pope Gelasius I made February 14, originally part of the Roman festival of Lupercalia, a feast day dedicated to St. Valentine. The stories of the different men seem to have merged into one over time, with most of the mythology about Valentine being a patron of lovers, helping early Christian couples to marry in secret, only dating to the 14th century and the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer.
Today, there are no less than ten places claiming to house the relics, all around the world, including the Basilica of Santa Maria in Rome.Read more about Skull bits of St. Valentine in Chelmno on Atlas Obscura...Category: Relics and ReliquariesLocation: Chelmno, PolandEdited by: Annetta, Rachel</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Archie the Giant SquidThe monster at the center of the  Darwin Center Spirit CollectionHeld in a custom-made acrylic tank filled with a 10% solution of formol-saline, the giant squid at the center of the London Natural History Museum Spirit Collection was caught off the coast of the Falkland Islands in March 2004. 
The 8.62 meter long creature is an Architeuthis dux, or giant squid, and known at the museum as "Archie." Although enormous, the giant squid is not actually the largest of the feared semi-mythical undersea ship eaters: that position of honor is reserved for the colossal squid, or Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni. 
Rarely seen, and even more rarely caught, this specimen was caught alive, although it did not remain that way for long. After death, it was transported to the Natural History Museum where it was frozen while a tank large enough to accommodate the huge specimen was designed and built.
The Spirit Collection at the London Natural History Museum holds about 22 million preserved zoological specimens, including the original collections of Sir Hans Sloane, an adventurous 18th century traveler and collector, who also is known for having introduced the drinking of chocolate milk to Europe. His collection alone numbered some 80,000 items. The new Darwin Centre opened in September 2009.
Archie's final resting spot is a specially built 9 meter long transparent tank, made by the same people who made tanks for Damien Hirsts' formaldehyde specimen installations.
The Spirit Collection (and Archie) can be visited on special guided tours.Read more about Archie the Giant Squid on Atlas Obscura...Category: Watery Wonders, Fascinating Fauna, Natural HistoryLocation: London, United KingdomEdited by: Annetta, Rachel, Dylan</div>
