      	<div class="entry_summary">Plum Island Animal Disease CenterA tiny islet just off Long Island offers a wealth of infectious curiositiesFor many, the mere mention of 'Swine Flu,' 'Avian Influenza' or 'Mad Cow Disease' can set off twinges of paranoia and an irrational fear of lunch. But for the researchers at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) off the coast of Long Island, New York, these terms set off a different sort of excitement. 
For over 50 years, this tiny island has housed a government-run research operation concerning animal-borne diseases. First a military research base tasked with researching bio-weapons, that program was shut down by President Nixon in 1969. PIADC is now a joint effort between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security, with the only objective being to research existing animal diseases.
While technically not researching bio-weapons, the center's primary function is to examine extremely dangerous diseases and study their potential impact on the population and agriculture of the United States. This includes their potential use as weapons by agro-terrorists - thus the inclusion of Homeland Security. Diseases studied by the PIADC include foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever, with a particular focus on likely or easily weaponized strains.
Legend surrounds the island due to its history as a secretive military base and original research into the creation of new biological weapons. Locals still contend that research is done on animal breeding, particularly hybrid animal creation. 
The latter concern is evidenced by the relatively famous "Montauk Monster" incident, during which the carcass of an apparently vicious and unrecognizable creature washed ashore on the mainland. Locals immediately suggested its origin was Plum Island, contending convincingly that it was an escaped lab experiment, captivating the local media. Experts eventually concluded that the mystery creature was simply a raccoon, and its odd appearance the result of waterborne decomposition. The legend, however, remains.
Many buildings on Plum Island are dilapidated and no longer in use, mainly due to the changing purpose and function of the facilities it housed as decades have worn on. However this "abandoned" gestalt has only fed local intrigue about shadowy operations and diseases run amok, including legitimate concerns about potential risks posed by the island's history and activities. 
Many such claims were made by Michael C. Carroll, PhD, who suggested in his book Lab 257 that the facility was responsible for several disease outbreaks in the past half-century, including recent West Nile Virus scares.Read more about Plum Island Animal Disease Center on Atlas Obscura...Category: Instruments of Science, Ghost TownsLocation: Edited by: Mark_Casey, Rachel</div>

      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Mother Shipton's Cave and the Petrifying WellOnce thought to be the mysterious work of a witchy prophetess, a well with unusual properties turns objects into "stone".Mother Shipton was said to be a witch and an oracle, predicting doomsday horrors and disasters that were to befall the Tudor reign, each morbid forecast recited in prose. Allegedly born as Ursula Southhell in a cave in the forests of Knaresborough, she was associated with all kinds of tragic events and dark doings in the area, including the bewitchment of a nearby well that turned objects into stone.
“The world to an end shall comen eighteen hundred and eighty one.”
-Mother Shipton
Taking the post-humous credit and blame for many strange happenings throughout he UK, Australia and the U.S. throughout the 17th, 18th, and even the 19th centuries, Mother Shipton left quite a legacy. Besides several published editions of her prophecies, her name graces pubs and her effigy and statues are used by fortune tellers. A moth whose wings appear to bear the image of a hags face was named after her, and a caricature of her is believed to be the first adaptation of the British Pantomime dame.
One of the mystical secrets of the enigmatic Mother Shipton has been solved by modern science.

<h3>Mother Shipton's Cave and the Petrifying Well</h3>
<b>Once thought to be the mysterious work of a witchy prophetess, a well with unusual properties turns objects into "stone".</b><p>Mother Shipton was said to be a witch and an oracle, predicting doomsday horrors and disasters that were to befall the Tudor reign, each morbid forecast recited in prose. Allegedly born as Ursula Southhell in a cave in the forests of Knaresborough, she was associated with all kinds of tragic events and dark doings in the area, including the bewitchment of a nearby well that turned objects into stone.<br>
“The world to an end shall come<br>n eighteen hundred and eighty one.”<br>
-Mother Shipton<br>
Taking the post-humous credit and blame for many strange happenings throughout <br>he UK, Australia and the U.S. throughout the 17th, 18th, and even the 19th centuries, Mother Shipton left quite a legacy. Besides several published editions of her prophecies, her name graces pubs and her effigy and statues are used by fortune tellers. A moth whose wings appear to bear the image of a hags face was named after her, and a caricature of her is believed to be the first adaptation of the British Pantomime dame.<br>
One of the mystical secrets of the enigmatic Mother Shipton has been solved by modern science. The well nearby her dwelling that petrified objects left in its waters has been somewhat of a visitor's attraction since 1630, making it the oldest tourist spot in England. Once thought to be the work of witchcraft, it's now known that the water that can turn thing ike teddy bears, hats and other random items into “stone” within 3 to 5 months is due to the natural process of evaporation and an unusually high mineral content. <br>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Reynolds-Alberta MuseumAn automotive, farming machinery, and aviation museum located in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, CanadaThe Reynolds-Alberta museum has one of the world's best historical collections of transportation and industrial machinery.
Charmingly, the collection was started by Stan Reynolds a local car salesman, and collector, who stressed in his advertisements that he would take ANY kind of trade in. Naturally he ended up with an odd assortment of vehicles and machinery. This didn't bother him much as he was also a collector of usual machinery. ONe story goes that while serving in London during WWII, he collected bits of shrapnel, and brought them home for his collection. A pilot, Stan was known to cruise the area farmlands looking down in search of interesting machinery he would try and buy from the farmer.Stan donated his collection in the mid 1980s and the museum opened in full in 1992.  
The museum is not just of interest to machine and vehicle buffs. The collection of transportation, aviation, agricultural, and industrial machinery ranges from the 1890s to the 1970s, and traces the history of Alberta, giving a view into a changing Canadian landscape. From horse-drawn buggies to cars and wagons, the local blacksmith turned to huge factory, from horses to tractors, the museum traces the industrialization and mechanization of Canada's Alberta region. 
The museum contains over  400 vehicles, 95 aircraft, thousands of pieces of farm equipment, a library of farm and vehicle publications, a 1920s grain elevator, a 1930s service station, and a 1950s drive-in. Among the other prized items in the museum are a one-of-a-kind 1929 Duesenberg Phaeton Royale Model J, a Bucyrus Class-24 dragline(built in 1917 and the world’s oldest dragline) and a 1928 American Eagle biplane - the only surviving Canadian example.
However, perhaps the most interesting items in the museum are not the rarest, but the homemade and heartily used such as "a home built wire weeder, one farmer’s answer to the soil erosion that daily ravaged his family’s farm, and future" and "a tractor with a wash basin hammered into a wheel to repair it."  These were said to be Stan Reynolds favorites as well, machines which showed how they were used through the daily wear and tear on their parts. 
Reynolds passed away in early 2012 but left behind a lifetimes worth of passionate collecting.Read more about Reynolds-Alberta Museum on Atlas Obscura...Category: Museums and Collections, Retro-Tech, Amazing AutomataLocation: Edited by: elinar, Dylan</div>

Little remains of the castle today, but the subterranean Goblin Ha' (Gobiln Hall) is still largely intact. The Hall is described on the Royal Commission of the Ancient Monuments of Scotland website as follows:
"On the W of the enceinte are the remains of another range of buildings now only a few feet above ground, and from the most northerly of these, a stair leads down to the "Goblin Ha'", an oblong chamber 37ft by 13ft 2ins, built of ashlar.

If, for example, you arrive too late to tour the castle and everyone in your group is cranky, Kokoen Garden is a fine option.
Built in 1992 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Himeji municipality, the gardens are set at the location of several samurai houses – a fact established through seven archeological excavations. Set on just under nine acres, the gardens were designed in the style of the Edo Period, the period of Japanese History from 1603-1868, when shoguns ruled Japan (also known as the Tokugawa shogunate).  
Professor Makoto Nakamura of Kyoto University designed the gardens so that, which each turn down one of the many paths, the view changes and it appears one has entered another garden entirely. As such, the gardens are themed – the garden of the lord’s residence, complete with requisite bridges, waterfall and koi pond, a tea garden, where a formal tea ceremony can be enjoyed for an additional fee, a pine tree garden, a bamboo garden, a flower garden, etc. 
While the gardens are beautiful in any season, if you can arrange your schedule with a bit of spontaneity, go to Japan during cherry blossom season (any time from March to May, depending). It’s hard to predict, but an entire nation celebrating new life in the form of perfectly delicate flowers on previously barren trees is a once in a lifetime experience not to be missed.Read more about Kokoen Garden on Atlas Obscura...Category: Optical Oddities, Horticultural MarvelsLocation: Himeji, JapanEdited by: Phreddiva, Annetta</div>

The shop offers the world’s largest selection of ice cream flavors, and there are seemingly no limits to the variety of tastes for the most adventurous of palettes, all of them all-natural. “If you eat the spaghetti with cheese ice cream, it has real spaghetti and cheese in it,” says manager, Jose Ramiraz. 
After years of working for large ice cream companies, Portuguese immigrant, Manuel Da Silva Oliveira realized he could expand the horizons of ice cream, infusing it with all kinds of eclectic and exotic flavors, and opened Heladeria Coromoto in 1980. 
His first attempt was avocado, and he wasted over 50kg of ice cream trying to perfect it. Now, it’s a local favorite, and can be paired with a number of flavors such as sweetcorn or black bean, as well as mango or coconut to bring out its sweetness.
The shop serves locals and tourists from all over. There are about 60 flavors offered in the shop at any given time and the flavors are changed according to the season. Among the bizarre selections, one can find more traditional flavors like chocolate or vanilla.
The house special is called, “Pabellon Criollo” and combines the flavors of the traditional Venezuelan meal of beef, rice, plantain, cheese, and black beans.  Being in Venezuela, there are also plenty made with rum, such as rum-and-raisin.  Some odd named flavors include British Airways, I’m Sorry, Darling, and the blue-hued Viagra Hope, which is made of honey and pollen, but shares the bright, sky blue shade of its namesake.Read more about Coromoto Ice Cream Shop on Atlas Obscura...Category: Commercial Curiosities, Bizarre Restaurants and BarsLocation: Edited by: katiebaker4, Rachel, Seth Teicher</div>

While it still isn't Bora Bora, the facility is extravagant and multi-purpose, used for recreation, several different diving instruction packages, military training, and film production.

Patrick Dougherty is an artist who creates his large installation pieces with the very unusual medium of living trees. By weaving growing saplings into huts, cocoons, giant water pitchers and the human form, Dougherty has created over 200 site-specific sculptures all around the world.
His human-sized nest houses and other creations are made out of an assortment of different tree types including but not limited to pussy willow, birch, aspen, and maple. Wrapping the saplings around a branch substructure, he creates installations of swirling, naturally curved abstract tree art, usually reaching between 20 to 40 feet in the air.
This particular piece at the University of Southern Indiana was built with saplings harvested by both Dougherty and student volunteers to create a row of attached huts, complete with doors and windows that one could enter and poke around in. Unfortunately, because of the nature of his medium, his installations only last so long due to decomposition, and this one is no longer standing.

      	<div class="entry_summary">McElroy Octagon HouseOne of few lasting examples of the brief octagon craze that developed into follyOnly two octagon houses are left standing in San Francisco, but at one point in the 19th century this style of house was promoted as a superior and cutting-edge architectural style. Thousands were built in North America. These houses are usually two stories tall and feature a cupola (the one at McElroy has views of the Golden Gate Bridge). 
It all started with a 1848 book published by Orson Squire Fowler titled "The Octagon House: A Home For All, or A New, Cheap, Convenient, and Superior Mode of Building." Fowler claimed that the ideal but impractical home shape is circular, but the octagon closely approximates the sphere while being much easier to build. 
Octagonal houses were supposedly more efficient by using fewer materials while providing more light and being easier to heat. However, the acute angles in the floor plan made it difficult to partition smaller rooms and place furniture. 
Fowler built his own enormous octagonal house in New York with four stories and sixty rooms. Unfortunately, the mansion was declared a public health hazard and destroyed in 1897. This house, and eventually the style in general became known as "Fowler's Folly." 
The McElroy Octagon House in the Cow Hollow neighborhood of San Francisco (the area used to be dairy farms) was built in 1861. It was a family home through the 1920s until it was purchased by a utility company that neglected its upkeep. 
The California chapter of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America bought the house in 1952 for $1 and undertook restoration of the house. This Society still owns the house today and has curated several exhibits in the house relating to American decorative arts.Read more about McElroy Octagon House on Atlas Obscura...Category: Architectural Oddities, Eccentric HomesLocation: Edited by: rebeccaclara, Rachel, Seth Teicher</div>

John Middleton was born in Hale in 1578 a normal and healthy baby of humble peasant stock. Middleton grew to a height of nine feet and three inches (2.8m), so tall it is said, that he had to sleep with his feet sticking out of the window of his tiny cottage (a plaque is visible on the cottage which is just a minute or two's walk from the churchyard). Because of his ‘formidable appearance’ Middleton was employed as a bodyguard by a local landlord called Gilbert Ireland.
In 1617, on his way back from Scotland, King I stopped to knight Ireland and in doing so heard of his gigantic protector. Both master and servant were invited to visit the king’s court and a fine outfit of purple, red and gold was specially made for Middleton. 
It is recorded that the Childe and his master visited Brasenose College Oxford (Ireland was himself, a graduate and senior member of the college) where he had his portrait painted. There are only three portraits of Middleton in existence, and two remain at the college. 
Brasenose rowing club’s first eight still wear the “Childe of Hale colours” of purple, yellow and red in honor of their visitor. Samuel Pepys wrote about seeing the painted outline of the Childe’s hand (which remains to this day) at the college in 1668: “After came home from the schools I out with Landlord to Brasenose College to the butteries and in the cellar find the hand of the child of Hales”. 
In London John beat the king’s champion wrestler and in doing so broke the man’s thumb. Embarrassed by the defeat and displeased with the amount of money many of his subjects had lost in betting on the match, James sent the Childe home with the substantial amount of twenty pounds for his troubles. 
Unfortunately, jealous of his wealth and taking advantage of his apparently slow wits, Middleton’s companions mugged him on the journey back to Hale. John Middleton returned to the village penniless and remained there until he died in 1623.

Opposite the churchyard stands "The Hale History Tree" - the wooden sculpture represents the Childe of Hale and various features of Hale's history.

      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Empire Mine State ParkThe Empire Mine is "one of the oldest, largest, deepest, longest and richest gold mines in California."The Empire Mine was the shining diamond of the setting of the gold rush, producing 5.8 million ounces of gold during its operation between 1850 and 1956. While there are 367 miles worth of shafts and tunnels, most of them abandoned and flooded, it's estimated that the mine only yielded 20% of the hard rock gold it keeps safe in its depths.
The mine may have been closed long ago, but it still provides for it's small town in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, by serving as an education center and a popular tourist attraction for Gold Rush enthusiasts. 
Grass Valley, once a boomtown, is now a quiet but growing community overflowing with historic landmarks and Gold Rush history, and Empire Mine is its pride and joy. The mine was once owned by William Bourn Jr., who was possibly the richest man in the country in the early 1900s and well known for funding some of the most intriguing and lavish homes in California.
Bourn spared no expense on the beauty of the grounds, and dedicated restoration and care has resulted in the houses, gardens, reflection pool, fountains and greenhouses looking just as they did in their heyday. 
While the grounds are beautiful and fascinating, the real treasure lies below, in the Underground Tour. To immerse visitors in the full experience of an underground mining operation, the park is preparing a tour into an 800 ft. tunnel that joins a 1860s drift off of the main shaft of the mine. Throughout the tour deep into the rock, visitors will see displays, old photos, and hear about the history and the culture of the mine and the Cornish miners who worked beneath the surface.
Another unusual place to visit in the park is the “Secret Room." A tightly guarded corporate secret, for almost 100 years no one except the board and the owners knew about the room containing a perfectly accurate scale model representing 5 square miles of the underground workings. Now a stop on the guided tour, the model was once an indispensable tool for mapping shafts and stopes.
The Underground Tour is still under construction. According to the website, progress is steady. While there is much to see and do there, it will probably be the summer of 2013 before you'll be able to descend into the mine itself.
“The Over-the-Hill Gang (OHG) has been granted permission to start construction. Since that time they have been working on "roughing in" the utilities; phone, water and electricity within the adit itself and have made great progress. Work has also begun on the displays.The latest Estimate for the opening of the Tour is mid- 2013.” says Empiremine.org.Read more about Empire Mine State Park on Atlas Obscura...Category: Museums and Collections, Unique Collections, Architectural Oddities, Subterranean SitesLocation: Edited by: Rachel, Seth Teicher, Dylan</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Sungei Road Thieves MarketA licentious look into Singapore's past, full of disorderly bric-a-brac and disreputable characters.Nestled in between construction sites, half-built apartment buildings, and high rises are two tiny streets and one fenced in, decrepit, abandoned lot. This is what remains of the Sungei Road Thieves Market, a patchwork of a flea market with vibrant characters and a colourful history.
If you find yourself in Little India or in Kampong Glam, a stop by the Thieves Market is obligatory, especially if you want to see the remnants of a past that has been obscured by skyscrapers, Louis Vuitton, and Mercedes Benz. 
The tiny intersecting streets are lined with “vendors,” their mats spread on the ground, shaded by tattered umbrellas and tarps. Their wares; indefinable.  You’ll find everything from thirty year old unopened bottles of coke, to bundles of wires, broken electronics, ten year old cell phones, CD’s, a plethora of watches, rusty nails, fake coins, and, if you’re in the market, a collection of lonely, solitary shoes.
Over the years, Sungei Road gained its notoriety as an unregulated market for fenced goods and disreputable characters.  A history of opium dens, poverty, and general unlawfulness have not garnered much favour from the Singaporean government. As such, the state has slowly been hemming it in, with property sales and gentrification of the area pushing the market into two small streets.

<h3>Sungei Road Thieves Market</h3>
<b>A licentious look into Singapore's past, full of disorderly bric-a-brac and disreputable characters.</b><p>Nestled in between construction sites, half-built apartment buildings, and high rises are two tiny streets and one fenced in, decrepit, abandoned lot. This is what remains of the Sungei Road Thieves Market, a patchwork of a flea market with vibrant characters and a colourful history.<br>
If you find yourself in Little India or in Kampong Glam, a stop by the Thieves Market is obligatory, especially if you want to see the remnants of a past that has been obscured by skyscrapers, Louis Vuitton, and Mercedes Benz. <br>
The tiny intersecting streets are lined with “vendors,” their mats spread on the ground, shaded by tattered umbrellas and tarps. Their wares; indefinable.  You’ll find everything from thirty year old unopened bottles of coke, to bundles of wires, broken electronics, ten year old cell phones, CD’s, a plethora of watches, rusty nails, fake coins, and, if you’re in the market, a collection of lonely, solitary shoes.<br>
Over the years, Sungei Road gained its notoriety as an unregulated market for fenced goods and disreputable characters.  A history of opium dens, poverty, and general unlawfulness have not garnered much favour from the Singaporean government. As such, the state has slowly been hemming it in, with property sales and gentrification of the area pushing the market into two small streets.  <br>
Two fruitful tips: if you’re planning to go, go (it might not be there next week) and if you see something you like, buy it (it won‘t be there next week)!</p>

Every day, 600 freshly baked cupcakes are waiting behind a facade that works much like the ATM cash machines we are already accustomed to. Any time, day or night, you can insert your credit card, make a selection from the rotating flavor descriptions, and for $4.00 a piece, purchase that emergency snack cake you so desperately needed. You can then watch on the display as a robotic arm retrieves your treat and delivers it through the cupcake chute located directly beneath the screen.
It seems unfair that the privileged residents of Beverly Hills (and their pooches, the machines dispense doggie treats as well) are the only ones receiving this remarkable technology. Fear not, for the cupcake ATM is coming to New York City in the sumer of 2012, and Sprinkles has been taking suggestions for other locations. 
Besides its current 10 stores, they have implied they would like to place cupcake ATMs in towns and on streets that are nowhere near a Sprinkles store, insuring equal and just cupcake dispersal to all, and are taking suggestions.
As of 3/5/12, the only place this confectionary convenience can be enjoyed is on S. Santa Monica Blvd in the 90210, but keep your eye on the Sprinkles Facebook page (facebook.com/sprinkles) for a Cupcake ATM opening up near you.Read more about 24-Hour-Sprinkles on Atlas Obscura...Category: Commercial Curiosities, Bizarre Restaurants and BarsLocation: Edited by: Rachel, Dylan, Seth Teicher</div>

Inheriting a fortune in mining, and then later building up Pacific, Gas and Electric, now known as PG&amp;E. In fact he may have even been one of the richest men in the world when he built his grandiose town house in the posh neighborhood of Pacific Heights. 
Modest by Bourn's standards, this 27-room mansion was built in 1896 by Willis Polk. A masterpiece of the bricklayers' and stonemasons' arts, the mansion was only one of the elaborate buildings Bourn owned, the likes of which included palatial Empire Mine in Grass Valley, CA., and the Bourn's famous estate, Filoli in Woodside.
Despite it's classic, upper crust beginnings, the 70's were a crazy time in San Francisco, and the mansion saw it's share of debauchery. Purchased by eccentric Arden Van Upp, what was once a classy, Georgian-style home became a swinging party pad. The perfect place for lavish hedonism, the mansion was visited by rockstars, movie stars, porn stars, and overflowed with good drugs, fine wines, and sexual abandon. 
Eventually, the party ended, and like most narcissistic eccentrics, Arden Van Upp fell out of favor, while the house fell into disrepair. She became a shut in, her only companions her white Chinchilla Persian cats. Garbage piled up, as did the debt and the lawsuits. Eventually, Van Upp became bankrupt and the house was deemed uninhabitable. By 1998, the mansion was so decimated that the homeless people squatting inside had to move onto the yard.
The house was finally cleaned up and sold at auction in 2010, and despite assessments that repair would cost quite a bit more than the house is worth, it remains a Historical Landmark and still stands at 2550 Webster Street. Locals who are attached to the mansion with the hard-luck story are hoping that the new owners are willing to restore it's former beauty, despite the cost.Read more about Bourn Mansion on Atlas Obscura...Category: Architectural OdditiesLocation: Edited by: rebeccaclara, Rachel, Dylan</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Berlin Botanical GardenStarted as a kitchen garden, now the second largest botanical garden in the worldEstablished as a kitchen garden in 1679, the Botanical Garden in Berlin is the second largest botanical garden in the world, second only to Kew Gardens, located in England.
The garden evolved from a kitchen garden growing vegetables and hops for beer brewing to a “considerable plant assemblage,” and in 1879 the Royal Botanical Museum was founded, encompassing every area of botany.
The sheer size of the gardens and the lush density of the plant life is overwhelming, especially when taking into account that so many of these plants are endangered in their natural habitats. What grows strong and vibrant in this collection is often threatened with extinction elsewhere. This assembly of gardens, sixteen greenhouses, and landscapes exhibit a microcosm of nature's diversity, home to flowered vines, rock cliff waterfalls, timber bamboo reaching to the sky, and a carpet of ferns, orchids, and bromeliads at your feet.
The Victoria House delivers a proper tropical environment with sweltering humidity that the orchids and lilies love, a bamboo bridge that transports you over the basin and into an exotic plant paradise. 
With 43 hectares and close to 22,000 plant species, one visit won't even come close to allowing you to see everything. Make sure you make the most of your day there and don't miss the Great Pavillion, which at 20 meters high and 30x60 meters in floor area is the largest glass house in the world. 
Other must see displays include the giant water lilies, carnivorous plant specimens, and a small cemetery, located to the left of the green house complex when coming from access at the Königin-Luise-Platz. Keep a look out for the sarcophagus of Friedrich Althoff, a university tutor deceased in 1908, which consists of a dolorous female figure meant to represent science in mourning.
Also of interest, but currently not open to the public (or anyone for that matter) is a series of tunnels built near the Botanical Gardens in WWII. Entrance to the bunker was through two tunnels leading from the farm of the botanical garden. Built for the SS to house personal and files during air raids, after the war the entrances were blown up, and the tunnels now serve as a winter roost for bats.Read more about Berlin Botanical Garden on Atlas Obscura...Category: Extraordinary Flora, Natural History, Horticultural MarvelsLocation: Berlin, GermanyEdited by: Rachel, Dylan</div>

Mooresville's famous Gravity Hill (near Magnetic Acres) is an optical illusion, but it is a convincing one. If one were to put their car in neutral at the "bottom" of the hill (or place a ball in the road, for the safety-conscious), the hill will immediately start to pull it "up" - in the wrong direction, according to our old friend gravity.
Legend has it that a school bus stalled at the bottom of this hill decades ago when it intersected with a railroad track, then was struck by an oncoming train, killing several riders. Nowadays, the locals will tell you that it's the spirits of the children on that bus that push things uphill and out of harm's way.

        <div class="entry_title">Pigeon Point Lighthouse</div>
        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Pigeon Point LighthouseA New England-style lighthouse along California's beautiful Highway 1 gets a re-doDriving down the coast along California's famous Highway 1 is many a road tripper's dream. Adventurous sightseers can take it from misty Portland to sunny San Diego, but the most famous stretch is beautiful central coast of California, between San Francisco and Big Sur. There you'll expect to find innumerable beaches, windswept mountains and rocky cliffs, but you might not expect to find a New England-style lighthouse rising out of the surf.
Pigeon Point Lighthouse rests at the top of a cliff, far above the crashing surf thundering through the rocks it was built to warn ships against. Built in 1872, the lighthouse is still operational, though only as a navigational aid for the US Coast Guard training purposes. Mostly, it's a picturesque piece of history that was almost lost to the sands of time.
The lighthouse and the land it's built upon have always belonged to the State of California. However, for several decades in the mid-twentieth century, the land was leased and used by the Coast Guard. Terms of the lease allowed the Coast Guard to perform only routine maintenance to the lighthouse, but not major restoration, and as a result it fell into disrepair.
Relatively recently, the lighthouse was returned back into the hands of the state, and a restoration effort has begun.

<h3>Pigeon Point Lighthouse</h3>
<b>A New England-style lighthouse along California's beautiful Highway 1 gets a re-do</b><p>Driving down the coast along California's famous Highway 1 is many a road tripper's dream. Adventurous sightseers can take it from misty Portland to sunny San Diego, but the most famous stretch is beautiful central coast of California, between San Francisco and Big Sur. There you'll expect to find innumerable beaches, windswept mountains and rocky cliffs, but you might not expect to find a New England-style lighthouse rising out of the surf.<br>
Pigeon Point Lighthouse rests at the top of a cliff, far above the crashing surf thundering through the rocks it was built to warn ships against. Built in 1872, the lighthouse is still operational, though only as a navigational aid for the US Coast Guard training purposes. Mostly, it's a picturesque piece of history that was almost lost to the sands of time.<br>
The lighthouse and the land it's built upon have always belonged to the State of California. However, for several decades in the mid-twentieth century, the land was leased and used by the Coast Guard. Terms of the lease allowed the Coast Guard to perform only routine maintenance to the lighthouse, but not major restoration, and as a result it fell into disrepair.<br>
Relatively recently, the lighthouse was returned back into the hands of the state, and a restoration effort has begun. Donations are being accepted from the public to help fund the landmark's repair and preservation. One of the more exciting aspects of the restoration, replacing the massive Fresnel lens, took place in November 2011. The Fresnel lens is 16 feet tall, 6 feet in diameter, and weighs 8,000 pounds.<br>
A hostel is also operated on the lighthouse grounds, offering mostly young travelers incredible views of the ocean and surrounding scenery for as little as $23.00 per night. Amenities are in short supply and the area is remote, but the location is unbelievable.</p>

      	<div class="entry_summary">Haraldskær WomanBog body on display in Danish church In 1835, while excavating some peat on an estate in Jutland, Denmark, farmers found a female body lying supine in a bog. Once the farmers removed the layers of branches that covered the body, they saw that she was naked and had a leather cape and woolen garments folded atop her abdomen. If not for the antiquated garb, the farmers––because of the excellent condition of the body–– thought the woman had died only recently.
Once the body was taken to a lab for further examination, forensic biologists marveled at her well-preserved skin, deeply bronzed because of the tannins in the peat. Every single organ in her body remained intact, with no sign of degenerative disease. The doctors determined she was about 50 at her time of death in 490 BC; they determined she stood about 4’11. 
In 2000, scientists revisited the case of the Hardaldskaer Woman (named for the estate where she was discovered), and found that her stomach content revealed a diet of unhusked millet and blackberries. They also found a distinct bruising around her neck, suggesting that a rope had once been tied around this area. Scientists also assumed that the woman had already died before the branches fell over her, pinning her body further down into the bog. Because of her nudity, careful placement in the bog, and since cremation was the most popular way to intern someone in that period of Jutland, the scientists deduced that the Haraldskaer Woman was a victim of religious sacrifice. 
Now the Haraldskaer Woman rests in an ornately carved sarcophagus in the St. Nicolai Church in Vejle, Denmark. There is only a simple glass covering over the body; she seems to rest peacefully as visitors the world over pay homage to one of the only human remains of the Iron Age.Read more about Haraldskær Woman on Atlas Obscura...Category: MummiesLocation: Edited by: acclarkey, Dylan</div>

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Rustic Canyon's Murphy RanchWorld War II-era Nazi compound nestled in the Santa Monica hillsHidden under dense foliage and down a treacherous decaying flight of hundreds of concrete stairs lies a World War II-era enigma. The now heavily graffiti-tagged Murphy Ranch sits nestled on a canyon floor between Will Rogers State Park, a Boy Scout camp, and a substantial, upscale housing development. Local journalists and at least one historian speak of the wonder and mythology of this fascinating historic ruin.
Now property of Los Angeles City parks, Murphy Ranch was originally developed to be a self-sustaining compound in the 1930s. It was originally purchased in 1933 by Jessie Murphy -- a person never seen nor documented elsewhere. Despite the phantom owner, the property was developed by Winona and Norman Stephens and a German national by the name of Herr Schmidt. The design implemented was an installation of several buildings, fuel tanks, and multiple massive cisterns. The entire complex, according the plans of Herr Schmidt, was to be self-sustaining even if it suffered years of isolation from the outside society. Schmidt's motivations, however, remain the focus of the lore.
A suspected Nazi sympathizer, Schmidt had a domineering personality. He convinced the Stephens to pour some $4 million in the construction of the ranch in Rustic Canyon. Despite a commanding presence, Schmidt was limited in his ambitions by the Stephens' assets. Plans to expand the compound were halted as the Stephens -- though still loyal to Schmidt -- ran dry. Schmidt, according to legend, persisted in pursing his dream of a Nazi holdout in America until the end of the war. This dream was shattered in December of 1941. Immediately after entering the war, United States Federal Agents raided (or are said to have raided) the compound hidden in the woods. Schmidt and his followers lost their dream, as they had the entire time been under the watchful eye of intelligence officials.
Abandoned for decades after the war, Murphy Ranch experienced a brief revival in the 1960s and 1970s. An artists' colony started itself there, just outside of the reach of bustling Los Angeles and Santa Monica. Wildfires in the canyon system ended the Ranch's renaissance, however, driving out the artists' colony permanently.
There are two popular approaches to Murphy Ranch. One is for hikers coming from neighboring Will Rogers State Park. The other is from the residential road Capri Drive. Hike north along Sullivan Fire Road until you reach a concrete staircase on the left after about 2/3 of a mile. If you miss it, don't worry, there is another, more roundabout entrance at a set of stone gates that follows the old driveway down. Using the staircase route makes the hiker feel like Rocky Balboa, descending over 500 steps some 200-plus feet in elevation. At the bottom you'll see tucked away under the trees -- like a lost temple of old -- the tagged piers and vacant windows of the remains of Murphy Ranch.Read more about Rustic Canyon's Murphy Ranch on Atlas Obscura...Category: Architectural Oddities, Incredible Ruins, Outsider ArchitectureLocation: Edited by: Cheddar, Nicholas Jackson, Rachel, Seth Teicher</div>

Cafe Racer itself has some unusual menu items including the "Wonder Wiener." The wonder wiener consists of  a polish dog split in half, with a slice of bacon placed inside and grilled. The wiener is then stuffed with cream cheese, green chilies and onions, and served on a toasted bun spread with special sauces mayotard and waa-la. Due to the artery clogging potential, they recommend only one per week.

The Victorian actress and singer Lillie Langtree supposedly stayed in the bedroom named after her. <br>
Although Victorian houses often included Fainting Rooms with a chaise lounge and smelling salts for women, Abigail's Victorian Mansion is not for the faint of heart, or the discriminating minimalist.</p>

Unless, of course the Gods had decided to adorn the entire island with precious stones. Which according to Thai mythology, they did. 
Precious, indeed, because the Gods – precisely the God of Tarutao, a Thai deity – is said to have placed a curse onto the island.

Each year the the National Park office which manages the island receives dozens of stones returned via mail,  sent back by people who want to lift the curse.

Even though you cannot take the stones home, you can play with them within the boundaries of the island for as long as your inner child wishes to do so. Thai people, for example, use them to build miniaturized cheddis and kneeling in front of them, they lay their most ardent wishes and prayers.

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Body Farm in PennsylvaniaA macabre farm reserved part of its 222-acres for dead bodies, all in the name of science“Old MacDonald had a farm, ee i ee i oh.  And on that farm he had a…pile of dead bodies…?” This will soon be the tune of farmer John O’Laughlin at Grace Lair Farm in Tyrone, Pennsylvania. 
Mr. O’Laughlin donated a sizable piece of his 222-acre farm to the California University of Pennsylvania to be used by students and researchers as an outdoor laboratory. This anthropological research center or “body farm” will be a place where human cadavers are analyzed in order to better understand the process of human body decomposition for the sake of forensic analysis. Sadly, it will not be open to the public.
This body farm will be the fifth in the country and the first in the Northeast. The others are located in Tennessee (University of Tennessee), North Carolina (Western Carolina University), and two are in Texas (Texas State University and Sam Houston State University). The smallest, at Western Carolina, can hold up to 10 bodies at a time, while the facility at Texas State University is five acres.  
These facilities play an integral role in developments of forensic anthropology.  "Whether it's looking at crime scenes, or putting the bodies there, we're going to provide meaningful education to students in the field,” says Dr. John R. Cencich, director of California University’s Institute of Criminological and Forensic Sciences. 
The fact that this will be the first facility in the Northeast is notable because it is located in a completely different geographical region from the other four farms.  Bodies decompose at different rates depending on the climate, and the more elements human cadavers are exposed to, the quicker the rate of decomposition.  Therefore, the hot and humid summers, the cold and snowy winters, and the regular precipitation throughout the year in Pennsylvania offers new discoveries in the field of forensic anthropology.
Plans are still being made and details are still being sorted, but Old MacDonald will soon have a new sort of farm that will keep scientists, students, and investigators well occupied.Read more about Body Farm in Pennsylvania on Atlas Obscura...Category: Strange Science, Memento Mori, Repositories of KnowledgeLocation: Edited by: katiebaker4, Dylan, Rachel</div>

It was the filming location of the 1979 horror film Phantasm, and the mansion on the grounds served as the mortuary run by the Tall Man, portrayed by Angus Scrimm. 
The Dunsmuir mansion itself, a 37-room building built in the Neoclassical Revival style that was popular during the late 1800s, was designed by San Francisco architect J. Eugene Freeman. It features woodpaneled public rooms, 10 fireplaces, a Tiffany-style dome, and inlaid parquet floors all within its 16,224 square feet. There are servants quarters as well in the house that are designed to accommodate 12 live-in staff.
The Estate takes its name from the two prominent Californian families who owned the house before the City of Oakland bought it in the 1960s. Alexander Dunsmuir came to the United States from Canada in 1878 to manage his family's coal business in the San Francisco Bay Area. He built the house as a wedding gift to his fiancée in 1899, only to die of illness while on their honeymoon in New York. She lived in the house until she died, just two years later in 1901. Isaias W. Hellman, who earned his vast wealth through banking, bought the estate in 1906 as one (of several) summer vacation homes for his family.
The grounds are home to sprawling meadows, gardens and a wide variety of trees including camperdown elms, bunya-bunya and hornbeam.
The estate is open to the public on Wednesdays starting at 11am promptly, and throws occasional events like Easter egg hunts. It can also be rented for events.

Named and mapped by New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), 1958–59, because it was on this feature that Dr. Edward A. Wilson and his party built a stone shelter during Robert Falcon Scott's British Antarctic Expedition, 1910-13 - Scott and Wilson's last.
Ed Wilson, Birdie Bowers, and Apsley Cherry-Garrard set out from Cape Evans in the middle of the Antarctic winter on foot and sledge, a 70 mile journey. They endured extreme cold, frost-bite, starvation, and near-death so they could be the first to collect emperor penguin eggs from the colony at Cape Crozier. The party ran into foul weather, lost a tent, and built a makeshift shelter out of rocks where they lay face down for three days waiting for the weather to clear. Their incredible journey is chronicled in Cherry-Garrard's "The Worst Journey in the World."
The "igloo" now looks like a ring of rocks filled with the tatters of the nearly failed expedition: penguin parts, shreds of canvas, wind-worn wool clothing, a test tube, rope, and rusted tin cans, all perfectly preserved by the Antarctic cold. It is Classified as a Category 1 heritage site (historic monument no. 21) by the Antarctic Heritage Trust.Read more about Wilson's Stone Igloo on Atlas Obscura...Category: Incredible Ruins, Dead ExplorersLocation: Edited by: vtoniolo, Rachel</div>

      	<div class="entry_summary">The Archer StonePrehistoric sandstone menhir with Early Bronze Age cup and ring markings, also known as Robin Hood's StoneIn the heart of suburbia, enclosed by green painted iron railings, lies an ancient sandstone menhir. A weathered bronze plaque within the railings explains the stone’s recent history:
“THIS MONOLITH KNOWN AS "ROBIN HOODS STONE" STOOD IN A FIELD NAMED THE STONE HEY AT A SPOT 198 FEET DISTANT, AND IN A DIRECTION BEARING 7 DEGREES EAST OF TRUE NORTH FROM ITS PRESENT POSITION, TO WHICH IT WAS MOVED IN AUGUST 1928.”
Robin Hood’s Stone seems a rather misleading name since there are no tales of the fabled outlaw and his merry band straying quite so far from Sherwood as Merseyside. The monolith was formerly known as “The Archer’s Stone” on account of a series of deep grooves worn into it, once believed to have been used during medieval times for sharpening arrowheads. 
As fanciful as this idea might seem, it is perhaps worth mentioning that during the 19th century the common consensus amongst antiquarians was that these grooves were created by Druids to aid the draining of blood from their sacrificial victims. It wasn't.
The grooves are now generally considered to have occurred naturally when the rock was formed and been further ingrained as the fragile sandstone was worn away by aeons of wind and rain. Archerfield Road is so named because it was built upon the site of the field where The Archer’s Stone once stood – the construction of that neighbourhood being the reason for the stone’s relocation in the 1920s.
Although the supposed arrow sharpening/bloodletting grooves are now considered to be natural, there are other, more intriguing, markings on Robin Hood’s Stone which are currently buried beneath a thick layer of concrete. A 1910 photograph of the now hidden end of the menhir clearly shows cup and ring markings thought to date from the Early Bronze Age, very similar to some of the markings on the nearby Calderstones in Calderstones Park. 
The photograph was taken by R. Stuart-Brown and published, along with at least one other of Robin Hood’s Stone, in his 1911 work A History of the Manor and Township of Allerton in the County of Lancashire, Liverpool. This other photograph shows the stone standing in its field with roughly the same portion of its surface underground as today – the cup and rings still very much hidden from view. Only when the earth was dug out around the base of the menhir were the ancient carvings made visible.Read more about The Archer Stone on Atlas Obscura...Category: Geological Oddities, Unusual MonumentsLocation: Liverpool, United KingdomEdited by: johnreppion, Rachel, Dylan</div>

This house and tower were built by a poet named Robinson Jeffers in the 1920's. He chose the rugged, wind-battered but beautiful coastal land to settle with his wife Una and their two sons. Robinson decided to be the apprentice to the contractor of the house so that he could build the tower by himself. He collected the stones from the beach below his house. The end result was passionate, irregular, and rather heroic. 
Robinson Jeffers' wrote mostly about nature. Carmel-by-the-Sea, sparsely inhabited at that time- and next to the wild, untamed mountains of Big Sur was the homestead he needed for continued inspiration. 
It was in the house that Jeffers wrote much of his poetry, including a famous poem called Tor House, an ode to "the wild sea-fragrance of wind," "sea-worn granite," and "evenings strung in the throat of the valley like a lamp-lighted bridge." Jeffers left his legacy in words and stones, writing that his ghost is nestled between the granite rocks of Tor house: "my ghost you needn’t look for; it is probably Here, but a dark one, deep in the granite."

      	<div class="entry_summary">The Ancient Chapel of Toxteth 17th century puritan church with connections to the Salem Witch TrialsIn 1618 the local Puritan community erected the Toxteth Unitarian Chapel on the corner of today’s Park Road and Dingle Lane. Since the 1830s it has been known as The Ancient Chapel of Toxteth.
The chapel’s first minister was a man by the name of Richard Mather who eventually emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts in North America. Mather’s son Increase Mather and grandson Cotton Mather later became known for their involvement in the infamous Salem Witch Trials of the 1690s. 
Prior to becoming a minister, Richard Mather was a school master and one of his pupils was Toxteth born astronomer and poet Jeremiah Horrox (sometimes spelt Horrocks). Jeremiah went on to predict, and to be one of only two people to observe, the transit of Venus across the sun’s surface on the 24th of November 1639. Horrox’s body was laid to rest in the chapel in 1641; he died in his native Toxteth having returned to the area only one year previously. A plaque dedicated to his memory hangs on the chapel wall, each of its four corners decorated with a five pointed star. 
Local legend has it that Oliver Cromwell’s troops camped in the Chapel's graveyard when they came to Liverpool during the Civil War.Read more about The Ancient Chapel of Toxteth  on Atlas Obscura...Category: Architectural Oddities, Curious Places of WorshipLocation: Liverpool, United KingdomEdited by: johnreppion, Dylan, Rachel</div>

        <div class="entry_title">Humongous Fungus Fest</div>
        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Humongous Fungus FestCovering 37 subterranean acres, this Armillaria gallic is a famous fungus with its own festivalWhile it may no longer be thought of as the largest and oldest living organism in the world, the people of Crystal Falls refuse to acknowledge the other candidates and continue to celebrate their very own Humongous Fungus, a Armillaria gallica fungus colony that stretches across 37 acres, weighs in at 21,000 lbs., and is around 1,500 years old. 
The title of largest living organism is a questionable one, and one that really depends on who you ask. Humongous was beat out by an Oregonian Armillaria solidipes fungus  measuring in at 2,200 acres, but it's disputed because although the colony is all of the same genetic makeup, it's not actually connected, comprised of many smaller individual groups growing close together.
Despite the controversy, the residents of Crystal Falls refuse to be deterred from throwing a “bang-pow!” of a festival in honor of the benevolent mushroom. Every August, locals and tourists alike commemorate the achievement of the invasive, wood-decaying fungus by turning the picturesque town into a fabulous event. 
For three days, revelers will enjoy a Pancake Breakfast, Volleyball and Golf Tournament, Horseshoe Tournament, softball games and a Tube Float down the river. Other major attractions include the Fungus Fest Parade, fireworks displays, and if there's room for it after all of the pie eating contests and ice cream socials, it's time for the major event – the preparation and eating of the Humongous Pizza.
The Humongous Pizza is, according to the confident residents of Crystal Falls, the largest mushroom pizza in the world at 10 ft. by 10 ft., not to be confused with the actual largest pizza in the world made in South Africa in 1990, which weighed in at 26,883 lbs. While perhaps a little exaggerated in grandiosity, at least it is made with mushrooms from the gargantuan guest of honor.
While the festival sounds like a pretty good time, the fungus itself isn't much to look at, since the majority of it is underground. Visitors expecting to see a giant mushroom as far as the eye can see will be disappointed with the small, protruding heads of what are commonly known as “button mushrooms” poking out from the forest floor for a short time in the fall. It may just be best to stay in town and enjoy the party.Read more about Humongous Fungus Fest on Atlas Obscura...Category: Extraordinary Flora, Wondrous Performances, Subterranean SitesLocation: Edited by: Rachel</div>

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Scottish Rite TempleOne of the largest Masonic temples in the world, created at the height of the oil boom in ostentatious styleWith ornate rooms designed to meticulously replicate historic periods and decorations riddled with arcane symbols, the Scottish Rite Temple in Guthrie, Oklahoma, is one of the largest Masonic complexes in the world. Completed in 1923 for around $3 million, it is a both a monument to the oil boom and the influence of the Masons in the state. 
Its history goes back to 1889, when the cornerstone for the first Masonic structure in Guthrie was placed. After achieving statehood in 1907, Oklahoma first had its capital in Guthrie before it was relocated to Oklahoma City, and the original legislative hall was later acquired by the Masons for their new temple. Although the original Convention Hall is now connected to the 1923 complex, it is still preserved in much the same condition as when it was finished in 1908. 
Marking the end of Oklahoma Avenue, which juts off from the elegant Victorian architecture of downtown Guthrie, the temple is an elaborate Neo-classical building made from Indiana limestone lined with Doric columns. 400 stained glass windows are incorporated into the building designed by the Oklahoma City architectural firm Hawk and Parr. The interior was overseen by Marion and Kathryn Davis, who also worked on the interior of Rockefeller Center in New York, and includes a 190 foot long, 52 foot wide marble two-story atrium as a tribute to the Roman Empire. 
The theater, also in the Roman style, has a 3,500 seating capacity and a Kimball organ with 5,376 pipes concealed in an arch over the stage. A Pompeiian Room has replicas of furniture found in the city consumed by ash, and the Assyrian Room has chandeliers designed to replicate the fire pots used by the Assyrians around 700 BC. 18th century English design is duplicated in the Crystal Room, named for its Czech crystal chandeliers, containing a rug weighing 1,000 pounds, which arrived by train, like most of ornamentations, from the East Coast. The Writing Room was done in the 17th cenury English style, with extra long chairs for the tall frontiersmen, and the library holding Masonic texts is in a Gothic style, although with an Oklahoma touch in the carved cowboys and Indians stalking each other along the tops of the walls. The Egyptian Room, a 300-seat theater, was painted in pigments mixed with egg whites, just as ancient Egyptians did with their temples. 
The Scottish Rite Temple is preserved in almost its original condition from when it was completed in the 1920s, and tours are offered of its detailed interior by Masons, who continue to use the temple as a center for Masonic activity in Oklahoma.Read more about Scottish Rite Temple on Atlas Obscura...Category: Architectural OdditiesLocation: Edited by: allison</div>

It houses everyone from Civil War soldiers to an assortment of vaudevillians to Jonathan Reed (the man who lived in his wife’s mausoleum).
It also holds the unidentified remains of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire’s victims, buried under a monument of a grieving woman. According to the cemetery’s records from April 5, 1911, there were eight graves: one man, six women, and one casket holding people whose gender could not be identified. 
On March 25, 1911, a fire broke out in a Greenwich Village sweatshop called the Triangle Waist Company. Because the owners kept the exits locked, the workers were trapped, resulting in an estimated 146 deaths, 50 of which resulted from workers jumping out of windows. 
The unidentified bodies were honored with a funeral procession that was attended by 400,000 mourners. Soon after, one of the women’s bodies was claimed by her family and moved to Calvary Cemetery.
One hundred years later, a researcher named Michael Hirsch came up with the possible names of the other six victims.

The garden was built between 1881 and 1883 for Leland and Jane Stanford on a site next to their proposed home.

      	<div class="entry_summary">Postman's ParkA quiet memorial to 'Heroic Self Sacrifice' in the heart of the City of LondonThis small and quiet park has a hidden gem, a wall of memorial plaques opened in 1900, commemorating the bravery of ordinary people, policemen and firemen who gave their own lives to save another. 
The plaques are exquisitely executed with ornate typeface and Royal Doulton china designed by leading tile designer William De Morgan. They are a pleasure to behold in this small green space in such a built up area, even before you begin to unravel the story behind them. 
The tales they illustrate bring to life a world devoid of warning signs and health and safety regulations, along with a sense of community spirit and two fingers up to the indifference that can sometimes be found in the modern world today. 
Some examples of the plaques: 
'Soloman Galaman Aged 11, Died saving his little brother from being run over in Commerical Street in Sept 1901'

<h3>Postman's Park</h3>
<b>A quiet memorial to 'Heroic Self Sacrifice' in the heart of the City of London</b><p>This small and quiet park has a hidden gem, a wall of memorial plaques opened in 1900, commemorating the bravery of ordinary people, policemen and firemen who gave their own lives to save another. <br>
The plaques are exquisitely executed with ornate typeface and Royal Doulton china designed by leading tile designer William De Morgan. They are a pleasure to behold in this small green space in such a built up area, even before you begin to unravel the story behind them. <br>
The tales they illustrate bring to life a world devoid of warning signs and health and safety regulations, along with a sense of community spirit and two fingers up to the indifference that can sometimes be found in the modern world today. <br>
Some examples of the plaques: <br>
'Soloman Galaman Aged 11, Died saving his little brother from being run over in Commerical Street in Sept 1901' <br>
'Alice Ayres, Daughter of a bricklayer's labourer, who by intrepid conduct saved 3 children from a burning house...at the cost of her own young life, April 1885'<br>
'William Goodrum Aged 60, Signalman. Lost his life at Kingsland Rd Bridge in saving a workman from death under the approaching train form Kew' <br>
 A great place to stop and hide from the bustle of the City and contemplate some of the finer qualities of homo sapiens.</p>

The museum was built in honour of Peter Mitterhofer, one of the machine’s many accredited inventors, with the help of typewriter collector Kurt Ryba’s donation “for all times and as an inalienable cultural heritage.”
Spanning 4 floors, the museum displays its most polished examples as part of a vast chronology of key-punching and space bar slapping, complete with theatrical re-stagings for those unable to imagine how things were typed before repetitive strain injury was conceived.
 A brief history of the world told through one appliance, highlights include the Malling Hansen, the famous ‘writing ball’ device that looks as if it were developed by Enlightenment physicians, and the world famous German Enigma encryption machines, the deciphering of which were, for some, instrumental in the Allied war effort. Occasional tables are set for viewers to have a go themselves, and punch a few lines into their tickets to take home as a memento. 
Mitterhofer was, as might be expected, an eccentric character, who “often argued with priests and policemen”. The first objects that he constructed range from a washing machine, a guitar, an instrument called the Hölzerne Glachter, which produces a laughing sound, to more mundane loudspeakers and picture frames. His first typewriter, produced in 1864 was deemed by Mitterhofer to be a ‘failure’, though in fact, of all the early machines, the shape and key format of his prototype most closely resembles the mass-produced models that prevailed. 
A show of interest to the museum’s staff could lead to a visit to the basement or “special showroom”, clad with wall-to-wall shelves that are stacked with the machines that the museum couldn’t quite squeeze in to its displays. Not for the faint-wristed, this archive contains all of the models that evade the typewriter canons: from black glossy proto-surrealist elegance to bright Disney playthings, along with all of the bakelite and melamine - Casio Elite, Smith Corona Deluxe, the IBM Selectric, and many, many more - that took their glimpses in the limelight inbetween.Read more about Peter Mitterhofer Typewriter Museum on Atlas Obscura...Category: Unique Collections, Instruments of Science, Electrical Oddities, Amazing AutomataLocation: Parcines, ItalyEdited by: trowel, Rachel</div>

The AquaDom was built by the Union Investment Real Estate GmbH at a cost of 13 million Euros for the aquarium alone. Biological management lies with the Berlin Society for Large Aquariums.
